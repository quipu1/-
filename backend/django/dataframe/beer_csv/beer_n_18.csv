Pours a light golden yellow color.  Aromas of grains and maybe some minor hop action.  Flavor was crisp, but sort a bland.  Still better than most lagers.

Perhaps one of the most watery beers I've ever tried.  Also, this had minor chill-haze.

A very good lager as the type goes.  Very tastey compared to that swill called american macro brew.  Enjoyable with Sushi.
