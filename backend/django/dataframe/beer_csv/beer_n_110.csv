Brown/orange color with a smaller light tan head. Looks more like a dark amber than a dark lager. Odd sort of caramel and lemon aroma. Light butterscotch, raw sugar…

Initially not a fan of Heineken Lager, this special was met with skepticism from the get-go. But it did end up exceeding my expectations and I have to say that this easy-drinking…

Decent off-white head lasted average length over clear brown ale. Better than Heineken Lagar, but not by much.  There are much more malts, of course, and the skunky taste is not…

Odd.  I dont know what they are going for here but its like a black and tan made with Budweiser and Killians.  It doesnt make for a real dark beer experience, rather light for that…

Pretty decent.  pretty good flavor, but took too long for the roastiness to peek out from behind a few slightly less desirable flavors.  I definitely like it better than regular…

Pretty good.  I enjoyed this one.  A little flat- it could definitely use more carbonation.  Looks like root beer.  No head at all.  Kind of a malty/caramel/cola flavor.  A little odd but good.…

Smoky malt aroma. Little taste, less body. Let's just not. The new rules say I must write 75 characters about this. Really this is not foul, just something hardly worth a description. I'…

Sparkling clear, ruby lager with a small, creamy, khaki-colored head. Very light milk chocolate in the aroma and flavor. Weak and watery. Well-balanced, but so is club soda. Light-bodied…

Reddish in color, with a smallwhiteish head.  Sweet aroma, I am thinking of carmel, and syrup.  Pretty sweet taste, sugary, camel, syrup.  A malty finish though.  Glad I can have tried it…

Not bad, but it was ice cold. I had to wait for it  to thaw, thought of making myself a nice eisbock.  Okay, better than the lager, kinda sweet, pretty much no head.  Bland brown,…
