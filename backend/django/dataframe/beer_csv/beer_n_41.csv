Can: pours a nice clear yellow with a big fluffy off white head.  I don‚Äôt know what to say.  It‚Äôs not what I turn to when I really want to drink a beer, but it‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs suppose‚Ä¶

With a nice yellow, champagne body, this beer isn‚Äôt too bad at all. Refreshing, yet bland at the same time - what kills it for me is the metallic taste that seems to accumulate... sip aft‚Ä¶

Clear as glass, pale yellow pour with a fluffy, white head.  The aroma is bland corn and slight skunk.  The body is light and thin with average carbonation, not champagne-like at all.‚Ä¶

Poured from bottle. This is the worst beer I have ever had. Smells of skunked corn. Looks like piss. Taste is very offensive. If your that hard up on money to buy this crap dig‚Ä¶
