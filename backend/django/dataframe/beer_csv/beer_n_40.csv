A really good tasting beer.  Not too strong and just about the right added taste.  Different from other beers... Which is nice to have.

Poured pale yellow with a foamy white head. Chemical nose and flavor that reminded me of an energy drink.  Somewhere between Gatorade and Tang.  Nasty.  Nothing about this…

Aroma is wet paper with some lime. Pale gold color with a white head that ringed. Rather thin bodied, with fizzy carbonation. Lime soft drink flavor. Not much else to say.

Had a bottle at a friend’s BBQ.  Is this beer?  It looked like a duck but didn’t walk or quack like one.  The ""hint of lime"" was NOT subtle.  It was like a sour lime-aid with a splash of…
