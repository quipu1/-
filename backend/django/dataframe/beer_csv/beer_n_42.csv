Golden color, excellent foam. There is a lot of metal in the aroma, in the malt taste and there is some kind of fruity note. Pilsner is not here, a typical Euro lager.

When I found this at a Philippino karaoke bar in Fort Worth, I had low expectations.  They were exceeded.  Not by much, but hey.

Straw blonde, lacy head. Pilsen and corn malt aroma with light graininess. Flavor is similarly lightly grainy with packets of corn and malting, but it finishes watery and estery.

A strictly average swill that had a decent colour and a fairly good head.  Aroma not offensive but the taste/flavour was forgettable.  I’d drink it again if nothing better was available.
