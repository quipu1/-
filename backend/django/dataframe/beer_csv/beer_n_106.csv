A small can from Chuan Lien down the road. Typical Korean macrobrew; plenty of rather sour vanilla, not disgusting, easy drinking.

Almost orange amber colour. On the nose, maltish, on the palate more plasticy sort of phenol-accented malt stuff. Ok for industrial Korean swill.

가볍습니다. 너무 가벼워서 오히려 자리가 애매한 국산 타 맥주보다 특징이 뚜렷하네요. 국산 맥주중 가장 가볍게 즐기기 좋은 맥주입니다.
