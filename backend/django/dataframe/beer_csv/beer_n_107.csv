If you took the label off this and served it, I would swear it is Tsingtao. Apparently, this light colored, light bodied lager, with little taaste or aroma, is a Chinese staple. Not much…

Pale gold, fizzy, head dies very fast.  Aroma rice, corn, wet earth, touch of sourness.  Bites the palate on the way down.  Flavor isn’t offensive, just standard adjunct lager.  Perhaps…

Green 600 ml bottle:  Not much to go on aroma or taste-wise, it’s all so faint.  Bright golden yellow body with a creamy white head.  The aroma is corn, a trace of sweet malt, and…

Bottle.  Pours thin gold with little head.  Aroma is corn flakes.  Flavor is sour grass with hop bits.  Palate is average.  I wasn’t expecting much, and I got it.

Clean lager. Very little flavor. Easy to drink, but nothing special. Just a standard larger IMO.

330ml can-pours a foamy white head that reduces to thin.  Color is yellow.  Aroma is sweet, grain.  Taste follows.  Fairly standard for the region.  Dated 6/23.

The best 'looking' beer I've seen from china (still quite a few to go).  Harbin unfortunately is also the best tasting beer I've had in China.  It's flavor is week and tries to make up for it…

Note: If you can get this in the bottle instead of can it is a much better beer.

Pale, metal aroma, even out of a bottle, and bland flavor.  Not worth drinking, but the other choices in China are usually worse.

Can.  The flavor is fine.  A bit hoppy and slightly fruity.  Had this at a Circle K in Hong Kong.  It said this was the oldest brewery in China.
