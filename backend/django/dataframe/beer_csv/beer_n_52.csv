Tastes really nice for for what it is. Clean lager very refreshing after a day of fishing. The older I get the more I seem to enjoy a cold lager on a warm day.

Halmgul och klar vätska med tunn skumslöja. Något sädig och lätt oren arom. Plastburkar är det första som far genom smaken. Söt och enkelspårig i utformningen.
