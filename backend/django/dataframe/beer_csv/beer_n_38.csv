Very similar to corona and Heineken. None of the nasty chemical taste of Budweiser products or Miller Lite or Coors, strange as it may sound. Easy refreshing summer beer.

Very weak aroma of light bread and yeast. Very watery, sweet, and somewhat stale taste, landing somewhere between fruit, wheat, and dishcloth. Almost no aftertaste.
