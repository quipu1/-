An English Style IPA, this beer opens with a fruity aroma set off by a dry malt middle and long hop finish.
Our India Pale Ale recalls a time when ales shipped from Britain to India were highly hopped to preserve their distinct taste during the long journey. The result is a hop lover's dream with a fruity aroma, set off by a dry malt middle, and long hop finish.
Bourbon in colour and 59 in International Bitterness Unit, our IPA uses Pilgrim, Styrian Golding Celeia, Cascade and Centennial Hops.
We don't need to be the only beer you drink.
We just want to be the best beer you drink."

8,구스 아일랜드 버본 컨트리 스타우트,Goose Island Bourbon County Stout,Stout - Imperial,🇺🇸 ,"""I really wanted to do something special for our 1000th batch at the original brewpub.  Goose Island could have thrown a party.  But we did something better.  We brewed a beer.  A really big batch of stout-so big the malt was coming out of the top of the mash tun.  After fermentation we brought in some bourbon barrels to age the stout.  One hundred and fifty days later, Bourbon County Stout was born-A liquid as dark and dense as a black hole with a thick foam the color of bourbon barrels.  The nose is a mix of charred oak, vanilla,carmel and smoke.  One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer.  It overpowers anything in the room.  People have even said that it’s a great cigar beer, but I haven’t yet tried a cigar that would stand up to it.""  Brewmaster Greg Hall;

Editor’s Note: Baudoinia Fulton &amp; Wood Series offering (And the Low Storage entry from FoBAB 2012) is simply Bourbon County Stout aged in the same barrels. It has been alted as it offers no different recipe or barrel type simply the presence of a distillers fungus on the barrels that adds no distinct characteristic to the beer from the fungus itself except for possible oxygen exposure changes. While Brewers Intent indicates that they consider it a new beer, no true distinction aside from this oxidation amount and possible aging time differences separates the beers. It’s essentially a single barrel Bourbon County version something we have always treated as regular Bourbon County Stout in the past."

13,구스 아일랜드 312,Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat Ale,Wheat Ale,🇺🇸 ,"Like the digits suggest, it’s a beer that’s densely populated with flavor and loaded with character. We don’t filter it, so none of its life and soul is stripped away.  The first thing you notice is the hazy, cloudy appearance. That’s how you know it’s unfiltered. What hits you next is the spicy aroma of Cascade hops, followed by the crispy, fruity ale flavor delivered in a smooth, creamy body, the result of blending barley malt with torrified wheat. It’s not like any other Goose Island Beer, but no less that you’d expect."

61,아사히 슈퍼 드라이,Asahi Super Dry,Pale Lager - International / Premium,🇯🇵 ,"Pasteurised bottle.


Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. 

Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.

Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste.
