The head fades very fast to leave only a very light patchy lacing.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The aroma is malty with notes of rice. With these aromas is a very light citrus hop aroma.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The flavor begins with a light sweetness and a malty flavor. The flavors up front are a mixed with some notes of a mild rice flavor. As the taste advances some more sweetness of a more sweet light caramel and corn flavor comes to the tongue. These sweeter flavors then begin to die down again more toward the end, where some light hop flavors come in to the taste and with the drying out of the sweetness, they combined to leave a crisper taste on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013The body of the beer is moderate in thickness and smoothness with a carbonation level that is a little above average. Rather appropriate for the style and makes it more refreshing.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 A fairly standard lager style for the most part.

I\u2019ve never understood this since these beers are very difficult to brew consistently and they lack flavor. The only thing going for them is their drinkability. And when it comes to Japan things aren\u2019t any different, as Asahi Super Dry is their \"No. 1 Beer\" according to the can. While I\u2019m not an expert on Japanese cuisine or culture by any means, I still don\u2019t get why this is the top beer there.\n\nI poured a 500ml can into a football-shaped glass.\n\nAppearance: Dark gold hue, almost crystal clear with slight haze. Large carbonation bubbles visible en masse. Forms a surprisingly large, bright white foamy head which eventually dissolves and leaves no lacing.\n\nSmell: Since this is from a can you wouldn\u2019t expect skunkiness, but I did detect a slight green bottle-like aroma here. I find macro pale lagers all tend to have a scent like this whether canned or bottled. There\u2019s a slightly sweet rice scent and an otherwise generic-to-the-letter cardboard \"beer smell\" here. It\u2019s not wretched, but it\u2019s far from appealing.\n\nTaste: Based on the appearance and smell, I literally \"braced for shock\" as I took my first swig of Asahi Super Dry. I was pleasantly surprised that my palate was NOT assaulted with anything sour and foul-tasting as is often the case with those green bottled lagers. Not that it was hit with anything pleasurable, either. What\u2019s most prominent about this beer is that there\u2019s nothing prominent about it at all. The palate is bland, neutral, pain, mild and whatever other adjectives you want to use to describe a lack of flavor.\n\nSince this is a Japanese macro adjunct it\u2019s no surprise it\u2019s made with rice as an adjunct, yet it doesn\u2019t taste nearly as sweet as its American counterpart Budweiser. It has a slight startchy-like flavor akin to crackers, which is slightly sweet. This increases as it warms, but at a point the green bottle-like components begin to come out too, with a sour, green apple tang. It\u2019s tolerable to be sure, but there\u2019s really nothing to enjoy about this beer\u2019s palate.\n\nMouthfeel: Starts off as a typical fizzy yellow beer with plenty of carbonation burn when drank very cold and quickly. Softens up to a more watery consistency as it warms. \n\nDrinkability: For beer that calls itself \"Super Dry\" I find Asahi to be anything but. It\u2019s actually a little refreshing, but then again it\u2019s a bland lager so that could be due to its overtly watery qualities. At 5% ABV it\u2019s very drinker-friendly, although I probably wouldn\u2019t session it unless I had access to plenty of salty snacks and used this to quench my thirst.\n\nOverall, a mediocre/below average macro lager.

I\u2019ve given pale macro lagers like these a lot of criticism, casting aspersions on their bland flavors, underwhelming palate, and criminal prices. They deserve it.  Japan\u2019s mass produced beers have unwaveringly followed the flavors and business models of other mass been producers, but at a higher price point.  Even so, Japan\u2019s mega-breweries are irrefutably icons of the Japanese economy.  Every tiny restaurant, izakaya, bar, pub and even some homes are decorated with logos from these breweries.  They are drilled into every civilian\u2019s head, day and night, through print and television ads.  Ebisu, Kirin and Sapporo stand atop buildings, high above the concrete labyrinth below in Japan\u2019s metropolises, bright and gaudy, almost foppish with their lights apoplectically blinking, advertising the golden juice just a few paces away in some patient convenience store or bar.  It is everywhere except your gut. For me, the most eminent of these dokodemo, itsudemo logos is Asahi.  I have no evidence that Asahi has a larger advertising budget, or has more images of its logo smeared around inhabited areas per meter than its competitors.  The difference between Asahi and other mass market brews is simple: the can.  Asahi is raw, nostalgic, and industrial.  It doesn\u2019t hide its aluminum skin under paints or colors.  When you look at a gallery of beers in a refrigerator, everything else is garbed in golds and colors, looking mature, but also exciting, and even a little desperate.  The Asahi is saturnine, stalwart, and sudsy.  It eschews the glitter and adheres to its roots - a metal can filled with beer.  One more grade of sheer brutal manliness and Asahi would be serving their beer out of tin pales and slop buckets.  It glows with the soft nostalgia of Showa, and is solidly dependable is an incredibly mediocre beer available almost anywhere whenever a poker game or a video game challenge breaks out.  Budget constraints suspended my beer drinking hobby while I was in Japan, but a can or bottle of Asahi made a great drink when I was sitting down with a bowl of ramen, or lounging around with some senbei crackers.

His white head fades rather quickly into a thin blanket which at least lingers through the majority of our session together. A steady stream of bubbles burst release a lively and crisp nose.

At the back of his nose is freshly mowed green grass drying in the sun. A flitter of key lime esters and sugar-coated lemon bars complete the nose and so, without further ado, I dive deep into his Super Dry depths. Not very dry, but his palate is faster than lightning because if I blink, I might just miss what I\u2019m trying to taste. Like a flash, there is no front or finish to this beer, just a quick stab of flavor centered on the top of my tongue. Lemon bars, creamy grains, and a faint wisp of honey sweetness. Key lime shadows flit and flicker in the light of his quick-flash palate. Maybe that\u2019s what the Super Dry is all about: a quick flash of flavor with nothing left to remind you of its presence. His mouthfeel is softer than I was expecting given all the Super Dry hype, which lends him a surprisingly soft and smooth mouthfeel which does little to actually dry my palate. A drain pour by no means, but through no manner of further quaffing will I discover any new lands of opportunity.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Asahi Super Dry is alright so long as one doesn\u2019t expect much of anything.
