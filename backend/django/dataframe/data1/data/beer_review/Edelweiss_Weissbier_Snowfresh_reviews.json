Pleasently surprised with this one. A flowery smelling beer that pours a slighty cloundy golden color annd short head. Distinct floral and herb palate without the soapiness.

Light body with very crisp, strong carbonation.  Cold, I found this a bit quiet in its expression but allowed to warm a little the flavours shine.  Stem glass.  Cellar temperature.
