I\u2019ve actually had Kirin Ichiban several times over the years (at hibachi and sushi restaurants) and I\u2019ve never really been impressed. This particular edition is brewed in the United States by Anheuser-Busch, though trying to find a fresh bottle is a challenge. Despite it being all-malt, it\u2019s a pretty boring lager. \r\n\n\n\r\nI poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 8/22/15 and cost $1.29 ($0.11 per ounce).\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Beautiful golden hue; crystal clear with visible carbonation. Pours to a large, white, foamy head which retains and laces remarkably well.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Lightly sweet pale malt blend. Faint touch of floral hops, otherwise quite mild in the nose.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: As I said, I\u2019ve drank this beer many times, and one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that it\u2019s consistently inconsistent. Some bottles are much sweeter than others; some are tinny and dirty-tasting. This particular bottle was somewhere in the middle, in that it was more mild and bland than anything else. I will say I notice a bit of light malt, but it\u2019s not especially delectable or particularly sweet. This is interesting, because I recently drank a year-old bomber of this beer at a sushi restaurant that was very sweet due to its age. Light-bodied pale lagers aren\u2019t the types of beers you usually associate with aging well, but I can honestly say that year-old bottle was better than this remotely fresh one. To its credit, I don\u2019t really find it repugnant at all. Just a touch of metallic sensation and maybe even a faint spicy hop presence. Its only crime is being not just dull, but extremely so.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: At only 5% ABV, Kirin Ichiban is equivalent to Budweiser in potency, though it is not a complete fizz bomb. Mouthfeel is quite light and there\u2019s a watery sensation to each swig. Slightly refreshing while in the mouth, which is nice, along with an almost completely clean aftertaste which is also nice. Though I use that term in a relative way.\r\n\n\n\r\nRATING: 4/10", "writed_at": "January 12, 2016"}, {"user_id": "alobar", "beer_kor_name": "\uae30\ub9b0 \uc774\uce58\ubc29", "beer_eng_name": "Kirin Ichiban", "review_score": 1.8, "review_content": "Pours clear pale yellow with no head.

It took a few minutes for the white, one-inch head to recede to a thin white sheet of fine bubbles floating atop the brew. When the beer first hit my tongue, I was fooled into thinking I\u2019d have a refreshing, slightly sweet pale lager to enjoy. Brew had a slight bready sweetness on the tip of the tongue, but when it flowed through the rest of my mouth it tasted like I was licking the inside of a wet cardboard box. Mouthfeel was a tad richer than I expected after the initial fizziness of each sip dissipated. I would count the tiny bit of unexpected richness as a plus. Overall, I very much hated this brew and I would definitely never give it a second chance unless I knew the first one I drank was defective or old.

Taste is again hops, sweet malts and grass and a slighly citrus/dandelion taste. Don\u2019t ask  me how I know what dandelions taste like ( childhood experiments) . It\u2019s a solid beer for every occasion. In many places now it is called Kirin beer and not Ichiban for some reason and I have noticed a slight variation in tthe taste. The Ichiban tends to be sweeter and maltier and the Kirin beer is slightly sourer with a sharper taste ( as described above ,,,,dandelions). I\u2019d say the Ichiban is better and brewed in Japan....which is weird as I live in Taiwan and when I study the bottle they both seem to be brewed in Japan ( I see both variants here).

Mesmerizing to look at.  The bubbly, snow-white pours to over an inch in height and settles in rocky fashion to a thin layer over several minutes, leaving scattered patches of chunky foam on the glass.  But the praise ends with the visuals.  Grassy and lightly sweet nose smells like generic macro-beer.

Body is light, clean, and quite carbonated for a lively mouthfeel and plenty of sonorous, reverberating eructations.
