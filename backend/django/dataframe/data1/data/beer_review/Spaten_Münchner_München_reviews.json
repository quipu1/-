Her nose is rich with grains, hay, and a dab of fresh honey. A bit of a delicate nose, there is thankfully no cloying corny sweetness, just a nice blanket of fresh grains and white breads touched by honey and lemon blossoms. My first quaff is bright and spritzy with tight carbonation. In a complete turn-around from her nose, honey arrives first and finds her seat while white bread, grains, and lemon meander on in, lazing around before settling in for the rest of the showing. Her honey is gently mouth-coating while lemon dances on top of my tongue. The white breads and fresh grains make up the meat of her palate, and the only thing I have left to do is happily quaff the rest of my glass.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nI have no problem being absolutely wrong about a beer, especially when it is a positive reversal of fortunes as is the case with the Spaten Premium Lager.

From the onset, the taste is friendly lager, very gentleman in the mannerisms.  I am very surprised this is styled as a dort/helles, it is so American lagerlike that I can\u2019t see that style. Absolutely no hints of oppressive bitterness, easy to like and easy to enjoy.   This beer will not offend anybody except the imperial stout and IPA drinkers. This beer is a mild lager that is repeatable and can be a good session brew.   No lager lover will complain about this beer, enjoyably excellent. During the finish there is an unexpected slight low bitterness that builds. Overall this is your typical American style lager and tho it is a good brew, there are many other cheaper beers out there that achieve the same attributes.  For example, Schmidt\u2019s is a good lager beer with the same characteristics but is much less expensive.
