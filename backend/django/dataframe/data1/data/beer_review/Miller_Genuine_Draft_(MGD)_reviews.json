Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Touch of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a very good pale adjunct lager style. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. very flavorful and never watery for the ABV. Perfectly clean pale malt/grain flavors, and nice earthy hop presence for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts at all, plenty of barley presence. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example.

Clear glass bottle, with a twist-to-open crown cap. 330 ml of golden yellow beer, alcohol by volume stands at 4,7%. Produced and bottled in Europe, God knows where, under licence from MillerBrewing Company. I like the label, with the eagle flying holding some barleys with its claws. Ingredients include \"selected cereal grains\" and \"hop products\".\r\nAs I said, golden yellow colour, with one finger of head, kind of soapy in texture, quickly losing half of its height but keeping the remaining half finger for quite long. Lots of bubbles finding their way to the top.\r\nSmell is very faint, some malts mostly and I think I smell rice. Does it contain rice? I don\u2019t know, maybe rice is one of the selected cereal grains the label mentioned. Well, at least it doesn\u2019t have the annoying corn smell.\r\nWow, fantastic taste! At the supermarket stands a label next to the bottle, recommending drinking it straight from the bottle. Allow me to disagree with that, I had a couple of sips and although the great taste is still there, is not so strong as when drinking it from a glass. Hmm, the more I drink it, the more conviced I am it contains some rice. So be it, they managed to give this beer a great taste.\r\nOn the body is as thin as someone would expect from a beer coming into a clear glass bottle. Very light carbonation, but it\u2019s so drinkable.\r\nOverall, I found this one to be a great beer. Too bad it costs 1,50 a bottle here.

The easiest way to check if the temperature is right is to drip a couple of drops into my mouth. The downside is of course that then I also taste the cloyingly sweet stuff, and if the milk has been in the fridge for a couple of days it taste even worse. If the milk has been stored for too long it tastes really bad, and into the drain it goes. I suspect that Miller keeps pumped breast milk in a too warm refrigerator for a week or two, before it is mixed into their beer. That must be the reason why the smell of the MGD is strikingly similar to that of stale breast milk, and what is even more scary is that the flavours are of too old breast milk as well. Along with some sugary corn flakes. A good thing is that both the aroma and the flavour is very weak, so it is actually possible to empty a bottle without getting sick. Not that it matters, but it pours a pale golden, clear and sparkling body with a small, white frothy fully lasting head. The reason why the head was still present as I emptied my glass, is of course that I drank this ghastly liquid as fast as I could.
