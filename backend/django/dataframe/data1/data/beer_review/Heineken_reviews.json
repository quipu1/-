They want to destroy a small beer manufacturer in an area of Romania where a large Hungarian minority lives because a very small brewery is able to beat them with a beer that supports traditions and local heritage. Heineken has started a lawsuit in order to stop the production of Igazi Cs\u00edki S\u00f6r (the new local beer). They claim that the name of their beer called CIUC PREMIUM has been stolen and used unduly by IGAZI CS\u00cdKI S\u00d6R. Can you see the similarity? Oh, of course not. Even if they claim that CS\u00cdKI is the translated version of CIUC, which is completely wrong. Local people have a sense of justice, pride and persistence, so they have started a boycott against Heineken. The point of this action is to avoid everything that is a Heineken product. Many people have felt that they have to join this action, even from Hungary. I believe Heineken has been experiencing a large decrease in sales, especially in this Hungarian area (Szeklerland), as a result of their lawsuit. As a result, they have been putting even more pressure on the manufacturer and are pushing the court to make a decision favourable to them. I encourage everyone who feels that this is an injustice NOT TO BUY, DRINK OR PROMOTE HEINEKEN PRODUCTS!

Do you work in the brewery? I asked. He said, \"Oh mon, I dee brewmaster!\" Needless to say, we got a tour for the whole hospital staff. At the end of the tour he left us in his office, equipped with a giant walk-in cooler, and said, help yourself, I\u2019m going home for the day.

It was canned on 11/8/13 and cost $2.69 ($0.11 per ounce).\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Clear dark gold hue with calm effervescence visible. Pours to a rather small, white, foamy head which retains and laces poorly.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Pretty standard pale lager aroma, though cleaner than most due to lack of adjuncts.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: I used to hate Heineken with a passion. The green bottles they\u2019re usually served in are skunky and taste sour. However, I\u2019ve started to come around on this brew, at least a little. I met the \"International Brewmaster\" last year and learned a lot about the brewing and pouring process. I also learned this beer is all-malt, unlike so many North American macro lagers. Additionally, this placed 2nd overall in a blind macro lager showdown I held with friends last year (and scored the highest of the pale lagers). I haven\u2019t had it since, so drinking it with this newfound respect has definitely swayed me\u2026 a little.\r\n\n\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, Heineken is still as much a macro lager as the BMC brands. It does offer slight differences in character, but they are quite subtle. There does seem to be some genuine malt flavor here. A touch of caramel or honey is noticeable and creates for minor sweetness. There also seems to be some faint, dry, spicy hop character to this brew. While nowhere near that of a pale ale, it\u2019s definitely stronger than most pale lagers. Unfortunately, even the can still seems to have a tang or astringent off-flavor on the finish. And the palate certainly isn\u2019t all that complex, either. Regardless, it\u2019s genuinely not bad-tasting from the can or tap; just avoid the green bottles since the lightstrike makes them drink like a completely different beer.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: Weighing in at only 5% ABV, Heineken should be a borderline light beer. But the mouthfeel is actually not all that light - it\u2019s a little heavier than most of the genre, but still has the crispness you want in a lager. It finishes clean, though it\u2019s not especially refreshing.

Pretty average pale lager fare, but I do appreciate Heineken\u2019s 100% barley malt recipe. Most macro-breweries cheat with corn, rice, or other adjunct sugars.

I can sometimes detect a minor \"skunkiness\" that other reviewers observe, but not always. People say it\u2019s because the hops go bad in the light green bottle. Maybe, but I suspect it has less to do with ingredients and more to do with an industrial-scale brewing process and lengthy, non-climate-controlled import process.

Oh, how the times have changed and how the clouds have cleared to show in full shining beauty the clarity of my ignorance. Ignorance is only bliss when it is still ignorance, but when ignorance steps aside to make way for enlightenment, only then can we, and I, appreciate the true folly of my views.

A few scattered bubbles float on top of her brew below, and after a few moments to try and give my over-chilled Heineken a chance to warm, I partake of grassy hops, hay, lemon and dank, almost rotten grains and malts. She is still bubbling away as I take my first quaff and wonder what delusion of youth I was under when I thought I enjoyed this back in the day. The brain-washing mass marketing of an inferior product maybe? Sweet and lemony hay make their presence known first while very quickly some bland and soggy malts and grains make up the middle of her palate. The finish is unfortunately rather rotten and kind of funked. Dank, wet, swampy, and none to pleasant, especially as it lingers long after the quaff and into the next. The crisp lemon, lager yeasts, and grass struggle to fight the good fight, but end up failing as I painfully finish my glass.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nI was truly hoping for better and have heard rumors that the can is better, but if the product inside is the same, I can hardly see why.

The flavor had a noticeably bitter bite on the first sip; the taste has more character than many pale lagers, and the hops are also more noticeable than usual in such brews.

The Oranjeboom was the worst - and with sugar listed in the ingredients it should be - it had not much taste, fizz or head and poured the same golden lager colour as the other two.  I had this beer in Holland and it was better than the Auckland version.  Heineken was the next - slightly more head but not much carbonation.  It had an astringent aftertaste that I associate with processed hops and industrial brewing.  The Stella was the best of the three with a lasting head and a hint of hops.  It amuses me that all three allude to a long brewing history on the labels - O associates itself with 1671, Stella with 1366 (hundreds of years before lager was invented) and H claimes to have been established in 1873 and won a Gold Medal in 1875.

Clear gold with a medium white head and little lacing. The nose is lightly hoppy with a pleasant grape character.
