Malty but doesn't taste like porridge. A bit of dried fruits, with alcohol slightly peeking through like it's a nice Belgian. I dislike most Belgians (except Divock Origi) but it is good, boozy but lovely in doing that. Overall, solid from an almost 8% beer. ***** PALATE: hooooooooooooooo booooy.

The garbage was precisely in line with the aroma and the taste. Slight dried fruit, slight malt, weak boozy undertone. All in a soft lager-ish beer. ***** OVERALL: Lovely.

Perdurer de cette fa\u00e7on m\u00e9rite tout de m\u00eame un certain respect.\r\nEn houblon, nous avons donc Herkules, Taurus et Hallertauer Tradition. Avec les deux premiers, on s\u2019attend donc \u00e0 une bi\u00e8re \u00e9pic\u00e9e avec une amertume prononc\u00e9e. L\u2019Hallertauer Tradition est quant \u00e0 lui plus sur des ar\u00f4mes floraux et sa pr\u00e9sence se justifie tr\u00e8s certainement pour essayer d\u2019\u00e9quilibrer l\u2019Herkules et le Taurus. En Malt, M\u00fcnchner et Pilsener : du classique. Restes \u00e0 savoir comment tout cela va s\u2019articuler. En verre, la robe ambr\u00e9e et limpide (EBC aux environs de 38) est plut\u00f4t chic. Une mousse blanc cass\u00e9e malheureusement trop peu abondante nappe \u00e0 peine la surface. Le nez, quant \u00e0 lui est tr\u00e8s beau. Un v\u00e9ritable voyage olfactif avec des ar\u00f4mes d\u2019orange confite, de pruneaux, de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales, de banane, d\u2019abricot et d\u2019\u00e9pices vari\u00e9s qui se m\u00e9langent pour notre plus grand bonheur. L\u2019attaque en est le reflet, compl\u00e8te, complexe et \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e sur le caramel, l\u2019orange confite et le pruneau; le tout relev\u00e9 de touches \u00e9pic\u00e9es (coriandre et poivre notamment). La deuxi\u00e8me bouche, sur le malt et des ar\u00f4mes de caramel, de biscuits et de banane, continue sur cette belle lanc\u00e9e. L\u2019arriv\u00e9e de l\u2019amertume en troisi\u00e8me bouche arr\u00eate cependant nette la belle histoire qui s\u2019initiait. La raison? Un manque d\u2019homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre les saveurs. La ligne directrice dispara\u00eet enti\u00e8rement sur des ar\u00f4mes ne se compl\u00e9tant pas. La deuxi\u00e8me bouche voit l\u2019amertume appara\u00eetre sur une intensit\u00e9 mod\u00e9r\u00e9e, des notes \u00e9pic\u00e9e comme on s\u2019y attendait et des ar\u00f4mes de pruneau. L\u2019arri\u00e8re bouche est alors des plus brouillonne et sans accord avec l\u2019ensemble. La transition avec le final est quant \u00e0 elle imparfaite et mal amen\u00e9e.

Paulaner Salvator was one of the first authentic German examples of the style I ever had. I thought it was good when I first tried it, but six years later I realize it\u2019s more than just good - it\u2019s a classic.\r\n\n\n\r\nI poured a 500ml bottle into a mug. It had a best before date of 5/2015 and cost $2.79 ($0.17 per ounce).\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Hazy/foggy appearance. Rusty burgundy hue. Pours to a one-finger, tan, soapy head which mostly dissipates and leaves no lacing.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Strong rich malty aroma with plenty of confectionery notes. A hint of alcohol and slight cider-like character (probably an old bottle).\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: If there\u2019s any style known for being a \u201cmalt bomb,\u201d Paulaner Salvator is it. From the first impression of the first sip it\u2019s all malt-dominate. Strong, sweet, delicious flavors of toffee and caramel right away with milder notes of toast and milk chocolate towards the back. Bitterness is dry and perhaps a tad spicy (most likely Noble hops are used in this brew). I detect a hint of mulled cider-like character towards the finish. This might be due to the bottle being old or it might just be natural melanoidins. Alcohol gives the palette some intensity, but adds little as far as flavor or distraction. Overall, a very tasty beer that would be fantastic when fresh.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: At 7.9% ABV, Paulaner Salvator is a big beer to be sure. The mouthfeel is surprisingly comfortable, though. Soft in weight and smooth in texture with intense flavor that\u2019s not abrasive. There is significant warmth from the alcohol, but this is by no means an obese or obtuse brew.

This was the first Doppelbock I ever tasted (and therefore a reference not just for the style as a whole, but for my personal appreciation of this style as well), from a \u2019tall boy\u2019 can some twelve years ago, but since my palate must have evolved since then, I decided to put it to the test and re-rate it from its classic 50 cl bottle, bought at an Albert Heijn supermarket.  Off-white, creamy, quite dense head leaving a thick, steady, moussy rim around the glass and thin patches of foam in the middle; lightly hazy, warm autumny amber-hued bronze colour, the archetypical looks of a Doppelbock.  Aroma of butterscotch and caramel candy, wet towels and even vague wet dog, soggy sandwiches, dry autumn leaves, brown rum, butter melting on a hot pancake, burning brown sugar, something vaguely root-like (cooked chicory), sugared tea, dried fig, some toasted bread, roasted tomato peel but much less of the actual ripe tomato scent I remember it had from the can twelve years ago, hazelnut, mineral water, \u2019jenever\u2019 and something - luckily - vaguely - and \u2019sulfurically\u2019 - slurry pit-like.  Sweetish onset with a sourish edge, no lively fruitiness so this is very clearly a lager, clean, with vague hints of dried fig, hazelnut and dried berries, vividly carbonated with a minerally effect, even numbing a little bit; smooth, full body, consisting of a full-fledged toffeeish and nutty maltiness, restrainedly sweetish but shifting to a mildly bittering \u2019toastedness\u2019 in the end, faint metallic \u2019zing\u2019 somewhere in the middle, leading to a malty finish in which the caramelly and toasted malt bittersweetness persists, quite one-sidedly so, but enriched with on the one hand a dash of herbal, almost tea-ish, but most of all rooty and lightly earthy hop bitterishness being subordinated to the malt character but serving its structural purposes very well, and on the other hand a glow of warming, subtly spicy, rum- or even brandy-like alcohol, which becomes a bit fatiguing in the end without descending into unpleasant astringency.  This beer seems less interesting than I remember so my suspicion proves right: the can I had back then, bought at a - at that time! - novelty beer store in Rotterdam, harboured a somewhat more complex beer, with unexpected smoky and tomato-like accents, and those elements, which I was looking forward to revisiting, are as good as absent from this bottle.  This is still very interesting, combining that typical wet kitchen towel-like aspect of so many lagers (regardless of style) with a deep, rounded, caramelly malt body, making it quite a saturating beer, as it ought to be with these strong, malty German beers.  Salvator is to be respected as the grandfather of a style in much the same way as Hoegaarden is to be respected as the archetypical Belgian witbier: an influential standard, more suitable than anything to get acquainted with the particular style, but surpassed by many others since its creation; neglecting 21st-century craft beer innovations, I would e.g. place Andechser\u2019s Doppelbock Dunkel (one of the exceptions in Germany in ignoring the -ator suffix) and Ayinger\u2019s Celebrator, the two most famous classic Doppelbocks after this, above this Salvator in terms of refinement and richness.  The alcohol could have been better hidden in this one and the sulfuric accent in the nose bothered me a bit as well.  Huge respect for this beer, and glad I revisited it, but objectively reviewed, this is a very commercial example of the style in spite of its traditions, more on a par with e.g. L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u\u2019s Triumphator and the like.  And my final critical note: do not believe the story that this is still brewed according to the recipe of Paula\u2019s friar Barnabas from 1773, as this industrial brewery would like you to believe: this beer is bottom-fermented, a practice that became generalized only in the first half of the 19th century.

An incredibly fluffy head (about two fingers high, off-white in color) tops it off with amazing texture,and mediocre retention.

Once it warms up in the glass, however, it smells less like a skunk\u2019s ass and more like the dying presence of German hops. Also of note is plenty of caramel and brown sugar.\r\n\r\nT: I pick up more in the way of dark fruits than I did on the nose, especially when it first hits the palate. The general flavors are caramel and brown sugar. I also get an apple note, distressingly similar to a macro lager - if I had to pick my least favorite part of the profile, this is it. On the plus side, I\u2019m surprised how hoppy the finish is given its proximity to the 11/13 best-by date. It honestly does a good job of cleaning the palate up, and also provides a nice bitter-ish balance.\r\n\r\nM: Like I said, the finish is drier than I anticipated - and that\u2019s a good thing! It helps to balance the syrupiness without killing the rich feel.

The body is medium and conveys a very moderate yet complex balance of malt flavors. This beer is complex while simultaneously being understated and highly drinkable. The finish has a dry crispness to it but also has the slightly sweet lingering flavor of the varied and rich malt bill. Carbonation is light. It is pretty clear why they have not modified the recipe since 1773 and how the monk's could live on this beer without food during lent.

Seeing as how the scriptures conveniently did not include beer as a forbidden fruit during their time of fasting (lent), the Paulists thus enlightened and revitalized their minds and bodies with their liquid bread; the doppelbock. Thusly named Salvator, at first all doppelbocks that followed were also called Salvator which led to some confusion as it became a name for the style in general. That changed not too long after as the Paulists claimed exclusive rights to the name Salvator for their doppelbock, though the \u201cator\u201d stuck and since then the large majority of doppelbocks have \u201cator\u201d at the end of their name.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nShe arrived at my side full of glamour and sparkle and grace, decked out in a breath-taking gown of deep amber while rubies glimmered and sparkled in her spotlight. Sporting a soft scarf of blanched copper, she swishes and swirls with seductive aplomb, offering a whiff of her forbidden lace which my eyes make sure to note. As we draw closure, I am able to steal a deep breath of her fruit. Sweet with caramelized sugars and moist dark breads while prunes and raisins are drizzled with maple syrup and a sprinkling of nutmeg. Weak in the knees I gather my will and lean in for our first kiss. No fireworks per say, but instead I am slowly drawn into her sublime embrace of spice and warmth which lingers on our breath even as she lightly coats my mouth with her liquid temptation. Maple melts into soft breads while moist prunes and raisins lead into a snap of lemon crispness in her finish that tingles on top of my tongue. Not too heavy, she balances my desires perfectly, and as my palate dries slightly, her lingering warmth hints of dry brown spices and rum. As I wholly surrender myself to her charms, she leaves me with one final kiss of sweet dark fruits, robust dark breads, warmth and spice, with a playful nip of lemon.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile the Paulist monastery and brewery are now separate locations, the Salvator is still just as tied to the Paulists today as it was hundreds of years ago when it was first brewed. Paulaner Salvatore is available year round, a blessing in and of itself.

Caramelization, Maillard components, toffee, hints of light molasses, toasted malt, browned-rustically-crusty bread and even something like a concentrated fruitiness (though not the kind contributed by ale yeast).  The beer is topped by a frothy, initially two-finger thick tan colored head that sits on top of a brilliantly clear, cranberry hued, dark amber colored beer.  I don\u2019t know why, but the malt focused aroma of this beer, at this moment in time, is hugely satisfying.  Complex in its malt focus, it makes me seriously think that this is still a decoction mash, or at least they fake it quite well.  The malt aromas are just so concentrated and enticing, it is almost pavlovian in the instinctual response that it generates in the olfactory portion of my brain.\n\n\r\n\r\nSweet, though not cloying; rich though not syrupy.  Above all it still has that deep, rich, malt character that I was really craving.  Flavors of caramelized brown sugar, and somehow a fruit character that has been unsweetened, yet still reminds me of dried figs and prunes.  This beer is clearly all about the malt character, though there is a touch of hop here, noticeable as a trace of bitterness and perhaps an ephemeral phantasm of herbal notes.  I really like how this beer is somehow not too sweet or cloying, despite clearly having a hefty level of residual malt sugars; chalk that up to the malt / mash / boil character.\n\n\r\n\r\nI probably prefer the aroma over the flavor as it was just about perfect to me in this moment.  This is still quite tasty &amp; over all this is just a great Doppel Bock.

Not surprisingly, this beer is noticeably better with a \"newer\" sample.

This \"fresher\" bottle displayed none of those qualities and was quite clean in its finish. NOW I understand why this beer is regarded so highly, by many.\r\n\r\nBottle labeled \"produced in 11/05; I bought it last week. Pours a clear reddish brown with a frothy, beige head. The nose is almost candy sweet with notes of caramel and prunes and a faint alcohol in the background. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, creamy and soft with a slightly sour, astringent finish. The flavor is a sweet caramel and prunes with a woody backing and a roasted, lightly sour finish. There is a hint of alcohol on the exhale but nothing significant. A tasty beer, but I have to think the sourness I was pulling from this bottle might be due to its age. I\u2019ll see if I can find a fresher source and re-rate it in the future.

Bottle\r\n$2.29\r\nHealth Mart\r\nProduced on 3/06\r\n\r\nSalvator poured a perfect caramel brown into my pilsner glass that sines with a reddish hue. Many tiny carbonation bubbles rise from everywhere to the small cap of head. The off white head started off about 1 finger on the pour but quickly fell down to the thin cap it\u2019s at right now. The clear caramel body really makes this beer attractive.\r\n\r\nFor me this was unexpected but the first smell I noticed was tart green apples. There\u2019s a solid caramel maltiness in the back but the apple really sticks out. Lightly toasted white bread shows up in there too. Fairly simple but unique and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThe caramel shows up first in the flavor but drops to the background quickly and lets doughiness step up. This doughiness shows up mid-palate and is then taken over by the tart green apples and a hint of alcohol. As it warms the caramel gets deeper. Again, simple but very effective.\r\n\r\nBody is medium with a thinner mouthfeel that actually compliments things nicely. Beer moves slowly through letting each flavor show itself. Small alcohol heat on the swallow.\r\n\r\nThis is definately an easy drinker. The body really helps this along with the simple flavors. The alcohol is a little too high to drink a lot but I could drink a few pretty easily.\r\n\r\nSalvator is a quality doppelbock. Unique with the simple but interesting flavors.

Sleek, steady stream of caramel to elicit bock smack.  Candy toffee cubes provide a flavor with only half of the requisite sugar.  Bready, semi-sweetened whole wheat bread.  Some butter-fried hazelnuts and liquefied golden raisins, and mulled apple butter with almond shavings.  Toned, nearly absent carbonation lets the ABV and chalky stream of alcohol protrude, though it\u2019s absent, dactylically speaking.  Rubbery toffee controls the mouth feel with partial numbing.  Mixed nut tin finish, somewhat dry, and a prevalent cocoa graham flavor in the aftertaste.

The monks were forbidden by the other Munich breweries from selling their beer until 1751 when they were allowed  to sell their Sankt-Vater-Bier on the feast day of St. Franz of Paula. In 1799 the monks brewery became the property of the Bavarian state, after which it based through various hands and changed names several times. The popularity of Sankt-Vater-Bier, which over the years had become corrupted to Salvator, led to many copies until in 1895 the brewery was able to trade-mark the name. Other breweries now use such name variations as Triumphator, Celebrator, Detonator, Maximator and Optimator. Since 1921 the brewery has bought up several other breweries and is now one of the biggest breweries in Munich. In 2001 Heineken acquired a 49% share in the brewery with the intention of promoting the Hefeweizen at the expense of many of the other products of the brewery.

The farmer says to the salesman, You dont deserve an answer but Ill give one anyway, behind the first hole was my wife and that is where she stays.
