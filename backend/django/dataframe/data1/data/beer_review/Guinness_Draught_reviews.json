Hist\u00f3ricamente los estilos Porter y Stout eran el mismo, cuando se hablaba Stout era el mismo tipo de cerveza pero referia a que contaba con caracter\u00edsticas mas fuertes que resaltaban el sabor y el car\u00e1cter que dictaba el estilo simple, la marca Guinness se especializaba en Porter y empez\u00f3 a incluir en su receta tradicional la malta negra que ellos mismos tiempo despu\u00e9s patentaron, luego agregaron copos de malta y emplearon malta tostada que doto a las Irish Stout de mayor sequedad, tambien a esta macro se le debe el uso de nitr\u00f3geno en los barriles anteriormente solo se utilizaba CO2, el nitr\u00f3geno al ser mas denso aporta cremosisdad a la cerveza mientras se desvanece y ya a finales de los 80\u2019s la implementaci\u00f3n del nitr\u00f3geno en las latas con la t\u00edpica pelota que contiene esta misma cerveza en esta presentaci\u00f3n, inovadora desde sus inicios. En la actualidad ya no necesariamente las Stout son mas fuertes o atenuadas que las Porter por la utilizaci\u00f3n de diversas maltas obscuras y procesos de fabricaci\u00f3n dejan una muy delgada linea entre algunos de estos estilos.\r\nLa Guinness Draugth vino a dar identidad a la cerveza de Irlanda en apariencia si se ve con detenimiento se podr\u00e1 constatar que no es del todo negra y tiene ciertas transparencias el las colindancias con el vaso de tonos rubi, esto es mas dif\u00edcil de apreciar en la version de lata puesto que como dije el nitro le da aparentemente mas cremosisdad a la cerveza que la versi\u00f3n de lata , posee un cuerpo diferente al de la versi\u00f3n con CO2, puesto que una propiedad como ya dije del nitro es aparentar cremosidad ademas de que mejora la retenci\u00f3n de la corona, ya que pr\u00e1cticamente es una nata que dura casi toda la vida de la cerveza, siempre y cuando se sirva de forma correcta. \r\nEn aroma impera el car\u00e1cter a caf\u00e9, maltas tostadas, costra de pan y cierto car\u00e1cter terreo, un aroma minimalista y de tradici\u00f3n para el pueblo irland\u00e9s. Ya en el paladar es acida moderadamente, toques a grano tostado, car\u00e1cter terroso, agua mineral, liviana en textura y un final muy seco pero que no es tan perdurable.

Probably slightly biased on this one (being Irish) but jesus, if you get a decent pint of this stuff it can turn any normal day into one of the best nights of your life. The Irish know that Guinness doesn\u2019t travel well beyond the emerald isle. But you can still get a good pint in other countrys. It seems the further you go, the worst it gets. Perhaps this is because there isn\u2019t as high demand in other countries for it (probably 2 - 6 being poured every hour in a normal-ish busy foreign \"Irish\" bar, whereas normal domestic bars it could be anywhere from 10 - 20+ per hour). A consistent flow makes for better beer that hasn\u2019t been sitting in the lines for a long time. In Britain, they used to (still do in places) pour it straight into the glass (disregarding it\u2019s settle time) and serve it directly to the customer which earned Britain (this, and other obvious things) a bad name for upon Irish people (never mind the IRA, don\u2019t mess with our Guinness lads, and we\u2019ll be grand). Anyway, with a good draught pour, Guinness can be an other world experience if done right. A nice price, in the right glass with a consistent pour and a head just brimming above the harp, you know straight away when the Guinness is good. After the first little tester sip, you determine the bitterness of the pint, the coldness and overall drinkability, and with this, if she passes, you slug away about a quarter of the pint in one go, leaving only a little thin white mustache above your lip and unquenchable desire for more.

This is mixed with a nice roasted coffee and the slightest bit of bitter cocoa flavor, just as is detected in the aroma.

Charred, roasted malt, and not much else.\r\n\r\nThere is a light sweetness that might carry a bit of chocolate or molasses with it, then soft roasted malt and an industrial bitterness as the sip finishes. The finish allows this bitterness to linger.\r\n\r\nThe feel is pretty bad overall. It is creamy, but just incredibly light, and the aqueousness really gets to me.

This contributes to its drinkability, yes, and I understand how Guinness would not be Guinness if you couldn\u2019t drink five pints of it per session because of viscosity issues, but the problem is, not all bottles come evenly carbonated, so whenever you get a well-carbonated bottle, you don\u2019t mind the palate feel so much, but when your bottle is not well carbonated, the beer feels really flat.

Will NOT re-rate...as I couldn\u2019t stand drinking this utter crap twice.During my college years beer drinkers that could be seen in bars locally could be classified into several types: consumers of crappy domestic beers, flocks of corona drinking females , imported lager consuming douchebags full of themselves and themselves full of shit and atop of all were fake beer-aristocrats, the Guinness devotees claiming \u00bbI drink only good beer\u00ab (Common myth was that Guinness has such a dense head that a coin put on wouldn\u2019t sink).\r\nGuinness is my favorite brewery too, in a negative way. It seems to be suffering from reversed Midas syndrome as everything they touch turns into crap instead of gold as I haven\u2019t came accross with decent product of theirs yet. Now I\u2019m tasting their Draught from some morbid curiosity and I\u2019m not disappointed - Guinness never fails to justify my low expectations. Guinness Draught is an excellent example of what happens when Marketing Department gets more founds than Research &amp; Quality Control. To the beer: Can with best before date 13.08.2010. The pouring into tulip reveals rather opaque dark muddy brown fluid topped with \u00bc of inch thin firm beige head that lasts. Apart from light acidic sourness and quite imperceptible alcohol nothing else is detected, maybe just a hint of bitter chocolate. Where is the coffee like aroma of burnt barley /barley malt so typical of a stout? Dominant flavor of this slush is acidic sourness derived from roasted cereals accompanied by unpleasant bitterness of charred organic matter. Now, I\u2019d expect at least a decent coffee finish but that\u2019s probably to much to ask of a Guinness. All in all the flavor profile is of bone-charcoal decomposing in water. The body is watery - probably a desperate attempt to enhance the drinkability - with zero carbonation. The above written refers to sampling from a tulip, straight from the can everything was even worse.\r\n\u00bbServe extra cold\u00ab - of course I will, cuz anesthetizing the tastebuds by freeze is the only way to at least to some degree hide the crappish character of this beer. Ironically, there is even a quality-warrant signature of Arth Guinness on the can, the same way as there is a central-bank governor \u2019s name printed on banknotes assuring their authenticity and stability of the monetary system.\r\nFinally: What is this - a sort of bizarre experiment how much crappishness can be bottled/canned and people will still be drinking it?

Another mammoth of the beer world up for rating. Guinness was probably the first stout I tasted a sip of, on holiday in Ireland with my parents when I was about 15. Back then, it was the meanest, fullest, richest and harshest beer I\u2019ve ever had - but then again, the range of beer I\u2019d tried back then was pretty measly. (Hey, I was 15, aight?) For years later, Guinness still resembled the archetypical \"ultra-strong\" beer in my consciousness. Over the past 2-3 years\u2019 journey into craft beer, I think its pretty amusing to look back on that feeling. The last time I had a Guinness was in a stout tasting evening, as a \"reference beer\". Not fair. Matching a Guinness against an army of imp stouts is like using a skinny, pimply adolescent boy to measure a team of MMA fighters. Anyway, enough chatter - on with the rating: dense, thick, everlasting nitro-head covers the near-black body, muting the aroma to a level where the only thing getting through is a slight whiff of roasted malts and some extremely mild hints of alcohol. It looks damn good though. Taste is mild, matching the smooth palate with touches of smoke, tar, licorice and coffee. While this may sound like an overstatement, I have to point out that these are merely *hints*, as opposed to any real flavor tones. The smokiness is probably the only feature which stands out; it is as if the beer makes an honorable nod to the rauchbeers of Germany, or the whiskey distilleries of its homeland. The palate is smooth, but the relatively thin body - compared to the roasty notes in the taste - pulls down the rating somewhat. Overall, Guinness is a a smooth, but ultimately watery brew which holds the promise of a good stout but is designed to...well, to NOT deliver.

While lots of folks are reaching for a pilsner or pale ale, I figured I\u2019d go the opposite direction, drinking some stouts, which I usually prefer to have in the dead of winter.  \r\n\r\n12 ounce nitro widget bottle.  Pours a dark charcoal black with a ful 1/2 head with incredible retention due to the injection of nitrogen.  The head just will not go down, and cascades down the side of the glass as you go on.  Smells of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate with that unique Guinness smell that I assume is a byproduct of the nitrogen.  One thing that has always amazed me with Guinness is just how quaffable it is - everyone assumes that dark beers are challenging to finish.  That\u2019s not the case with this beer.  It\u2019s easy to drink which is probably why I got into it in the first place.  The taste gives you lots of roasted and chocolate malt in the background, and the nitrogen lends the beer a nice creaminess.  Chocolate milk isn\u2019t necessarily the best description - Guinness isn\u2019t a milk stout - but perhaps something like Yoo-Hoo is more appropriate.  There are some hops there, though they are quite earthy and muted.  Fuggles perhaps?  The hops lend a nice and lightly bitter finish to the entire affair.  Overall Guinness remains an Irish classic and one of the best stouts on the market today.", "writed_at": "July 17, 2010"}, {"user_id": "Trevor7", "beer_kor_name": "\uae30\ub124\uc2a4 \ub4dc\ub77c\uc6b0\ud2b8", "beer_eng_name": "Guinness Draught", "review_score": 4.9, "review_content": "One of the worlds greatest beers if you can get it fresh and on tap, otherwise don\u2019t bother.

Careful not to dip my nose too deep into her mousy cover, I smell dry charcoal, ash, burnt white bread, powdered dark chocolates and finally, licorice root. My first quaff is more average then I remember, but memories have that fuzzy habit of being blurred between reality and fantasy. Her body is light and her palate bone dry, of course. Immediately parching my tongue, she goes in for the kill with a mix of ash, charcoal, powered chocolates, wood, burnt toast, and old licorice root. There is nothing to hide and no need to hide anything within her palate; Guinness has always carried her heart on her sleeve which has helped her flourish over the years. Nowadays, I am find her to be simply average. Each quaff is a reliable repeat of the same, and it doesn\u2019t take long at all for her to exit stage left. Before she does though, a whisper of crunchy caramelized sugars tease from the fringes of her palate, but not for long.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Guinness draught in the can is a far cry better than her bottled cousin, and the Guinness Extra Stout is the better of the two, here in the states anyway.

Drinking songs, like cigar smoke, lingered in that hall. And at the bar the punters sat and pissed the time away. I swore I\u2019d sit and drink with them until my dying day. My choice in beers and lasses both was vapid, thin and blonde, but deep down a part of me for something deeper longed. One day I called for something else, the barman I surprised. And on that day a deep, black stout for my first time I tried. The barman poured the rich, thick brew with patients and with care, and then he stopped two-thirds the way while at the glass I stared. Cascading like a fountain, those bubbles did their dance, such beauty I had not beheld, I cursed my ignorance. And once the beer had settled, again the barman poured, a frothy head and quaint shamrock atop this dark reward. \"Guinness up!\" the barman called and placed it on the oak. And to my shock the glass, I swear, like God Almighty spoke. \"Who are you to order me?\" to my surprise it asked. \"Some hipster writer, just a boy, I\u2019ll kick your little ass.\" \"Please,\" said I, \"I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d give me such a fright. I know that all this time so far, I have been drinking shite.\" \"Very well,\" the black pint said, \"sip me long and slow. I\u2019ll show you how a beer should taste and down your gullet flow.\" And so I raised the glass and sipped, my mind was all atwitter, and roasted barley I did taste so sweet and yet so bitter. The palate was like Irish cream, the likes of which I knew, but never did I think I\u2019d get the same feeling from a brew. And so I drank all afternoon, a stout virgin no more. I drank until I could not stand, nor walk across the floor. Years later I\u2019m a connoisseur, I\u2019ve tried the best and worst.

Let\u2019s see who comes out on top.\n\n\r\n11.2oz bottle, rocket nitro widget, no freshness date.\n\n\r\nPours black with a one finger+ off-white dense foamy nitro head.  Leaves lots and lots of lace and retains well alllllll the way down the glass.  Instead of looking for spots of lacing, one must look for spots of glass through the thick wall of foam.  Guinness is lighter in color in both head and body than the other two, but laces better and holds a better looking head.\n\n\r\nAroma is relatively quiet, perhaps due to the thick nitro head.  However, Guinness is the strongest and best smelling of the group.  Features good roasted malt, coffee and chocolate.  That nitro \"smell\" is there too.  Aroma is the weakest aspect of these beers.\n\n\r\nGuinness also wins the flavor shootout with nice roasted malt, coffee and chocolate.  Lightly bitter, lightly sweet, a little milky.  Tasty.  A lot of folks think this has no flavor, but that is BS.  Best tasting 4% ABV beer I\u2019ve had.\n\n\r\nMouthfeel is wonderful for me as I have a tough time with carbonation...even sodas, etc.  The nitrogen is perfect for my palate, ridiculously smooth, creamy, and quaffable.  These are the only beers on planet Earth that I could chug.  The body on Guinness is lighter than Murphy\u2019s &amp; Beamish and is the only real area where the classic lags behind.\n\n\r\nOverall this is a great session beer, beautiful appearance, nice flavor, and wonderful mouthfeel.  Guinness takes the crown in this little shootout with the best overall apperance, aroma, and flavor.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\nOriginal Review April 10, 2007:\n\r\nMy favorite simple, sessionable beer.  I could drink this every day....very nearly do.  Beautiful to look at poured into a glass.  A thinner beer than  you would think due to how dark it is.  Taste is mild and refreshing.  Excellent head.  A classic and deservedly so.\r\n\r\nThe real key to Guinness for me is the low carbonation.  I\u2019m not big on carbonated drinks, rarely drink any soda, and while I\u2019ll drink carbonated beer, I greatly prefer Guinness as it is soooo smooth and drinkable.  Relatively low alcohol content, but I drink it faster than most beers so its still quite effective.  :)\r\n\r\nAlso able to get 12-packs of the bottles for $13.49 nearby (north Georgia).  Best price I\u2019ve seen in my area!  The Food Lion next door charges $8.49 for the 6-packs.\n\r\nAr 7/10, Ap 5/5, T 7/10, P 5/5, O 16/20:  4.0 Score", "writed_at": "June 16, 2010"}, {"user_id": "Tanker12", "beer_kor_name": "\uae30\ub124\uc2a4 \ub4dc\ub77c\uc6b0\ud2b8", "beer_eng_name": "Guinness Draught", "review_score": 3.4, "review_content": "Great look when you pour this beer.

The finish is quite pleasant - fulfilling, somewhat dry, somewhat roasty, somewhat hoppy (though not bitter from hops). The mouthfeel is strange, thanks to the nitrogen. It is very creamy, but the bubbles are so small that it could almost be confused for being flat. Not the most interesting brew, but still a fantastic session beer.

While not being in any way a classic brew, it was softer and fruitier than I had remembered it. The intensity of flavours was somewhat muted by the coldness and the nitro blanket used to create that famous head, but it was pleasant enough.

Some vigorous shaking aids in removing the gas. Eventually a fruity and pleasant stout emerges, with a dry acidity. Licorice, oily fish and dark fruit flavours also come through. It\u2019s not a bad stout. It\u2019s not great either, but deserves some respect. There\u2019s an interesting range of flavours.
