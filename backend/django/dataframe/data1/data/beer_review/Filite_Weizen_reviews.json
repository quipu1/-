I have tasted filite lager, and found it appestizing, but this 'Weizen'  was undrinkable. Small head, with flavour of grapefruit, orange and lemonade.  Fuzzy to taste,  and was more akin to red lemonade than weizen. Had unusual, sweet, artificial candy smell. Poured down sink :)", "writed_at": "November 4, 2020"}, {"user_id": "Pyobon", "beer_kor_name": "\ud544\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc14\uc774\uc820", "beer_eng_name": "Filite Weizen", "review_score": 2.7, "review_content": "(Can - poured into paper cup - classy hotel) Pours pale amber with big fluffy white head. Aroma is orange soda, pretty intense, not bad but not a beer aroma. Light body with fizzy carbonation. Taste has a pleasant sour start and then an orange soda taste. Again not unpleasant but not obviously beer.  Unlike a soda there is little sweetness. It\u2019s quite drinkable and refreshing but disappointing as a beer.", "writed_at": "November 1, 2019"}, {"user_id": "fredthecat", "beer_kor_name": "\ud544\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc14\uc774\uc820", "beer_eng_name": "Filite Weizen", "review_score": 1.6, "review_content": "Hazy golden with a large white head that disappears quickly. Aroma is like artificial orange dish soap, bright, some maltiness, sweet smelling. Taste is more of this artificial orange smelling hairdye. Kind of like an unusual orange candy. Body is the same as the other Filite Happoshus.\n\nIt says weizen but the ingredients list unmalted wheat and its basically orange flavoured happoshu so I listed it as a wit. \n\nIt's not good. basically the orange flavour version of the green can with a big, one dimensional taste.", "writed_at": "September 3, 2019"}]
