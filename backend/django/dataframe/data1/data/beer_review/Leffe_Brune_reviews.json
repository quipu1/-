As predominantly a real ale drinker, I'd been left thoroughly unimpressed by the Leffe Ruby offering, which tasted like very cheap, bad, alcoholic Ribena, and smelt far worse to boot. It was my first try with any Leffe beer, and regretted it.\n\nSo, I cracked open this bottle of Leffe Brune/Bruin, which I'd bought at the same time as the Ruby version. First of all, it looked and smelled better. A lot, lot better. The traditional beer type smell gave me some confidence that I may actually enjoy this drink. Whilst I find it difficult to detect any scent from most beers I drink, at least this one didn't smell repulsive like Leffe Ruby did when I took a whiff of that. Nor, thankfully, does it taste repulsive, either. In fact, it tastes rather good. It's slightly more carbonated than say a British real ale, but this isn't a bad thing. It doesn't taste overly carbonated or fizzy, and keeps a good head once poured, all the way down the glass. It has a fairly rich flavour, with mild burnt chocolate notes with some subtle fruitiness. It's definitely not a bitter taste, but has some body and depth behind the flavour. Really pleasantly surprised by this.

Leffe Brune was originally brewed by Abbaye de Leffe, but that brand is owned by AB-InBev; so who knows if it\u2019s still being brewed at the same place it traditionally has been, or if it\u2019s made in an ABI facility. \r\n\n\n\r\nI poured an 11.2oz bottle into a wine glass. It had a best before date of 6/10/16 and cost $1.99 ($0.18 per ounce). Thanks to Mike for this bottle!\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Seemingly brown in color, though actually a deep shade of burgundy. Carbonation can be seen within. There is no sediment (this doesn\u2019t appear to be bottle-conditioned). Pours to a large, white, foamy head which laces and retains quite well.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Sweet dark malts not unlike that of an English brown ale, though the Belgian yeast esters are prominent and create for a lovely floral and fruit scent.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: This beer is marketed as Belgian brown ale, though that\u2019s not really a major recognized style. It\u2019s not quite a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, nor an Abbey Dubbel. It has the sweetness and flavors commonly found in British brews of the sort. Caramel, toffee, raisin, a touch of rum are all found in here. The yeast gives it a little bit of banana and also some peppery character on the back end. There\u2019s even a hint of smoke, but it comes across almost as dark chocolate. All these flavors seem to be authentic; I\u2019m not detecting anything faux and/or cloying. Overall, it\u2019s quite delectable.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: At only 6.5% ABV, Leffe Brune is fairly light for such a complex and robust Belgian brew.

It\u2019s all over the place here, and in the absence of anything better, I have tasted this often from 33 cl bottle and from tap. For this rating, I pour it from a 50 cl can - which I suspect is a packing aimed at alcoholics, or in any way not the most flattering packing for an abbey beer. Medium thick and thinning but more or less stable, lacing, dense, light beige head over a deep red brown, cristal clear beer with almost no visible fizz. Aroma has that off-putting cooked pasteurization dominance as expected from the brand, lots of artificial caramel, iron (even dominating initially), freshly cut grass, cardboard, nutmeg powder, dry cocoa powder, liquorice, raw cauliflower, biscuit, cooked corn, coffee with milk, dried leaves, old cookies. Taste begins with a candied but one-dimensional and bland fruity sweetness, simple and straightforward, with minerally carbonation effect, lots of artificial caramel, vague nutty malts in the background but mostly pale maltiness as in a bland standard lager, sweetish, cornish, very metallic with a slick and actually rather thin mouthfeel, some roasted maltiness in the end but low hop bitterness, somewhat watery. I am happy to buy the rumour that this is actually a pimped lager nowadays - I get practically no fruity esters when smelling this, it has the smell and feel of a straightforward Dunkel - and not even a good one. In any case: this is just as bland as I had expected it to be, even under objective analysis. I stubbornly refuse to understand why people still seem to like this and why it is rated so high on this site. This is an off-putting, industrial strong Euro lager in disguise, if you ask me.

Damn nice robustness and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

The head has a very fantastic level of retention slowly fading slowly to give a wonderful level of lacing.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The smell is big and sweet. The sweet is mainly of cherry and some banana and pineapple. Mixed with the fruity aromas is a good dose of roasted malt, a light nut, as well as notes of a yeasty nature.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins on the sweeter side with flavors of cherry and plum mixed with a good brown bread flavor. As the taste advances some yeasty flavors soon come to the tongue and bring with them some flavors of banana and a light spice flavor. More toward the end of the taste, more sweet caramel and dark fruit and bready flavors come to the tongue and mix with a light alcohol flavor to leave a rather dark and sweet but balanced flavor to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is on the average side with a carbonation level that is just below average. The medium creaminess is good as it keep the beer drinkable as well as compliments well the fruity flavors. The brew however is not so thin that the roasted and yeasty flavors are detracted from.

After having some fair exposure and experience to the style, now it\u2019s time to see if this popular big boy still stand as tall as I thought it was.\r\n\r\n\n\nLooks: Clear deep burgundy colour; Three-quarter finger head with crumpety light beige foams which lasts for 1 minutes; Beautiful sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.\r\n\r\n\n\nAroma: Very fragrant dark malt, with strong caramel, strong toffee, light dark chocolates, banana, plums, raisins, light vanilla, cream, sugar, Bel yeast, light spices, Bel yeast, light lemon and very light grass.\r\n\r\n\n\nTaste: Close to light sweet dark malt, with light roastyness, light nuts, caramel, light toffee, coca, toasts, molasses notes, fair Bel yeast, spices, lime, quite strong bitter hops and light grass.\r\n\r\n\n\nBody: Medium body. Slick and creamy palate.\r\n\r\n\n\nMouth Feel: Right-on maltyness woth some neat light roasty taste, in a pretty rich and creamy body. Fruity taste is minimal, replaced by good coca and burned toast. Caramel is not as strong as Leffe Blonde but match its overall dark profile. Fairly yeasty despite a lack of yeast sediment. Spicy and hoppy, more so than Blonde, keep my chop licking. Bang-on neat and nice!\r\n\r\n\n\nHoppiness: Light lemon, and light grass in nose. Strong lime and moderate grass in taste. Bitterness is expressive and tasty for the style, works well with the roast and caramel for a lasting mid-to-high astringent finish.\r\n\r\n\n\nAfter Taste: Quite Dry. Smooth and nice bitter to month.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: Despite its lack of bottled yeast and Big Boy reputation, this is still a very well-made and accomplished Dubbel: Its aroma and looks gave a nice first impression, and if the smooth and roasty dark doesn\u2019t win you over, the nice toffee, coca toasty palate and strong nice hops surely well. Yes it\u2019s InBev, but they sure keep the rep intact with high standards. Highly recommendable and like the Blonde, this is on my regular stocklist!\r\n\r\n\n\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\n\n(Original rating on 6/Feb/2013)\r\n\r\n\n\nDeep brown colour; Loads of lovely and lasting foams with very good lacing! Fine smell of malt, hops and faint citrus; Full body, taste is very well balanced with subtle sweet and hop taste (very little), with characteristic caramel and toffee after taste; Hop bitterness is very mild and subtle; Very nice dry and sweet after taste. At abv 6.5%, it get to the head quite fast like the Blonde, and again it is more about the nice euphoric feeling rather than getting flattened by cheap stuffs.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: Very elegant, really top quality stuff! If Leffe Blonde is for beginners (sweet), than this is for the matures (subtle sweetness and hoppy taste). Drinking the Brune is a very enjoyable experience! Like the Blonde, it is generally available locally at a fairly reasonable price.

A very thick foam rises to the top, a good finger and a half to two fingers thick. The beer itself is a very dark brown color, nearly completely opaque, but just a touch of light makes it through.\r\n\r\nAromas are full of brown sugar, roasted malts and candy sweetness. There\u2019s also a bit of spice and nutty notes in the nose, and maybe a little toffee?  On the palate the Brune is much lighter than expected!  With all that malty sweetness in the nose, I expected a bit more intensity in the mouth.  The Brune is fairly light in body dominated entirely by both fruity and roasted malts with a fair amount of alcohol shining through.  I\u2019m surprised how much the alcohol is noticeable, as the website lists the Brune at only a subtle 6.5% abv.\r\n\r\nThe Leffe Brune is a flavorful and smooth but not super impressive.

Beautiful dark burgundy color with an off white head. Aroma is yeasty with notes of caramel, molasses, brown sugar and spices: Clove, nutmeg and coriander. Wonderful. Taste is sweet and spicy, nicely complex, showing notes of Weinachts Stollen, cookies, caramel, nougat and dark fruits. A real dessert. The rest of the features are almost the same.

This time the flavor was somewhat better than the first time. This time I got notes of coffee, figs, nuts and bitter chocolate. Nice bitterness towards the end.

Head is light beige, big and frothy with medium retention. Good aroma of malt, showing notes of caramel, cookies and coffee. The slightly woody character is mixed with an alcoholic hint in the nose. Typical example of the \"Abbey Dubbel\" style. Flavor starts lightly sweet like a sweetened coffee but becomes progresively bitter, ending with medium duration. Unfortunately there is a strange yeasty/metallic thing in the mouthfeel and the alcohol is too dominant. Medium bodied, the finish is a bit astringent and pretty alcoholic.

[4.0] \r\n\r\nNov, 2005 Smokey aroma. Clean, sweet, smokey flavour with lingering bitter hops. That strange barley sugar flavour of pasteurised beer. But also, that wonderful harmonious blend of sweet and bitter that is so popular with drinkers in Northern Europe. I know this is pasteurised. I can taste it is pasteurised. But I can\u2019t help myself. I love this in the same way I love smoked processed cheese. Even the odd sharp plastic notes I find attractive. I can\u2019t help myself. Oh - I bet this would be heavenly served cask conditioned. J.D. Wetherspoon - please make this your next cask special! [3.7] \n\r\n\r\n June, 2003   I love this beer! [4.0]\n\r\n\r\nDec, 2002 I love this stuff. When travelling in Northern Europe it\u2019s readily available in most bars, and is better than a lot of the beer offered (Jupiler or Stella). In France it is regarded quite highly as they have a taste for smooth, sweet malty beer, and this is much better than their own Adelscott or Pelforth. It is an Abbey beer by licence, the Abbey Notre Dame de Leffe hadn\u2019t produced any beer for years and didn\u2019t have the equipment to do so. In the 1950\u2019s they hired out their name to a local brewer, and then the brewery giant Interbrew bought the name. This is brewed less in line with tradition than with an eye to the commercial market. All sourness, rough edges and individual awkwardness are left out of the recipe, leaving a very pleasant and easy drinking beer that still manages to satisfy. There are a number of flavours: apples, cloves, brown sugar, etc, but these flavours don\u2019t shift their intensity from one glass to the next - it is a consistent beer. As such some may find this boring, while others will find it reliable. Each beer has it\u2019s own time and place - if you sit at home sniffing and sipping this on your own you may find it a bit bland; but as an everyday social drink or something to accompany lunch in a French or Belgian bar, it is more than delightful.
