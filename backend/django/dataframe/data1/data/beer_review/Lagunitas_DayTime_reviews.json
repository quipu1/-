There is little, if any malt flavour or sweetness, and also little of the grapefruit or pine bitter, so it does come across as a sweet soda, with a mild touch of alcohol. Body is light, as expected for a session IPA, so perhaps tere is an absence of malts in this one, but is helped by the above average and effervascent carbonation, which helps it from going watery too soon.

Tons of carbonation bubbles can be seen streaming up through the brew. The head fades over a moderate amount of time leaving a fantastic level of foamy rings of lace on the sides of the glass.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 For a session IPA, the aroma of the beer surprisingly heavy on the grapefruit hop smell. Along with the more bitter grapefruit are some other aromas of a tangerine and mango sweetness with a little bit of a grassy and cracker aroma as well Overall the aroma is rather nice. \r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins with a smooth bready flavor mixed with a little bit of a grapefruit hop taste. As the taste advances the breadiness remains as a base for the brew, with it being joined later on by a little bit of a grainy taste toward the end. All the while the little bit of orange and caramel flavor that are present upfront seem to intensify in nature as the flavor moves on to the end. Later on in the taste, as the grapefruit hop increases a bit in intensity, other flavors of a lemongrass and a light floral hop taste come to the tongue. With these new found hop flavors and the nice increase in the sweeter and malty flavors of the brew, a very smooth, yet moderately hopped and enjoyable flavor is left to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 For an only 4.6 % abv brew, the body of the beer is on the thicker side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. While normally a lighter body and very high carbonation would be better for the session style, for amplifying the malt and the hop the slightly thicker (at least for a 4.6 % abv.) and lower carbonation do the brew nicely and really make this a nice session IPA.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 This is so far the best session IPA that I have had. Unlike most session IPA, it has a degree of balance due to a more malty and sweet presence and doesn\u2019t taste like I am drinking hops mixed with water. This was very enjoyable session IPA and one I would certainly recommend.", "writed_at": "October 19, 2014"}, {"user_id": "CanIHave4Beers", "beer_kor_name": "\ub77c\uad6c\ub2c8\ud0c0\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud0c0\uc784", "beer_eng_name": "Lagunitas DayTime", "review_score": 3.7, "review_content": "Bottle, shared by me... in my dining room... just now.\n\r\nPours attractively enough, very pale with a big white head and lots of lacing on the glass.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe aroma is fruity with melon and grapefruit being the dominant players.

Holding it up to the light, you will notice some very active rising bubbles in the clear body.\n\n\r\n\r\nAroma: Beautiful big citrusy danky nose, fresh grass. Pretty close to opening a pack of hop pellets. Some candied orange too as it warms.\n\n\r\n\r\nTaste: A punch of citrusy hops, very dry pale malt, a little earthy hop bitterness that finishes very clean. Medium duration for the lingering hop bitterness.\n\n\r\n\r\nMouthfeel: Thin and on the high side in terms of carbonation.\n\n\r\n\r\nOverall: Amazingly tasty and drinkable.
