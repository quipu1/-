Nothing off-putting.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: Miller Lite was the beer that invented the light beer style. This company has the most experience making this type of beer, and of the three major macro breweries they probably do it best. That\u2019s not to say this particular brew is amazing or anything. In fact, I couldn\u2019t honestly give it a thumbs up, but I would describe it as more than tolerable, but not quite average. \r\n\n\n\r\nIt begins with an extremely subtle malt character. It\u2019s pale as can be, though it does offer a hint of sweetness. Perhaps some biscuit or cracker character can be detected, though it is not starchy per se. Corn is of course quite prominent, but it is reserved compared to Coors Light. No tang or sharpness here. No hops either, though that\u2019s par for the course.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: I remember seeing commercials for this beer when I was a kid that said \"Great taste, less filling!\" While the first part of the statement is patently false, the second half is true. At only 4.2% ABV, Miller Lite is indeed chuggable and sessionable. Though the delivery is suspect - the mouthfeel is thin, watery and tepid - which is a bit of a turn-off.

Originally released in 1967 under the name Garblinger\u2019s Diet Beer, produced by Rheingold Brewery in New York, then sold to Chicago\u2019s Meister Brau Brewery and called Meister Brau Lite, the recipe was eventually acquired and tweaked by Miller in Milwaukee. \r\n\r\nFrom there, \"Lite Beer from Miller\" propelled Miller Brewing to become the 2nd largest beer producer in America by the mid 70\u2019s. More specifically, advertising for Miller Lite created by big name firms like McCann-Erickson and Fallon muscled Miller into household name status. By way of celebrity advertising featuring the likes of Rodney Dangerfield and Bob Uecker, and catchy slogans like \"great taste, less filling,\" Miller Lite broke into a male demographic that had previously shunned watered down beers. The loud, repetitive, antagonistic nature of those famous Miller Lite commercials were the hypnosis that rocked the beer psyche. Thus, it was the first mainstream lite beer, and under the heavy hand of marketing (remember the sense of male helplessness after seeing the 2002 \"Catfight\" commercial, which may have marked the final heyday of macrobrewing; or go to the Miller brewery itself where they still show a circa 90s bro-centric Millertime promotional video at the tour kickoff) the United States entered a 25-30 year comatose of beer mediocrity. \r\n\r\nStill! Even if it tastes like water mixed with corn syrup, this stuff is the benchmark for many beer drinkers. Mainly, it seems most popular with people who hit the prime of their drinking years in 70s, 80s and 90s. One example is deceased Chief Justice Rehnquist, a Milwaukee native, who would have a daily lunchtime \"Miller\u2019s Lite.\" Miller Lite is a posterchild, along with Spud Mackenzie, of that period. Just like clothing styles, it seems that the beers of the pre-Lite + tv ad era have made a comeback (PBR, Schlitz, Hamm\u2019s). \r\n\r\nFinally, here\u2019s my actual rating: Pale yellow, bubbles, ultra light bodied. I give it high marks in the palate category because they\u2019ve accomplished the objective of near nothingness and it is less filling than just about anything out there.

The smell is inoffensive, but barely there.  When you drink it with a bit of a head, you realize that some of that head is definitely artificial soda type carbonation and not a beer head as a craft beer drinker is used to thinking of it -- the foam almost feels lighter than usual.  The taste is predominantly water, with sweet grains, metal (This came from a glass bottle, I\u2019m talking about a taste in the beer itself), and a little bit of hops on the back end.  Honestly, sort of a cross between a regular adjunct lager and a glass of water.   It\u2019s not bad in the sense of being revolting in any way whatsoever, it\u2019s easy to drink.  It just is really lacking in flavor to the point where the water is the main thing.  Of the big three light beers (Bud Light, Coors Light, Miller Light), this one has the lowest carbohydrate total, if you\u2019re watching your carbs -- calorie count is roughly the same -- and I think is the best of the three.  I really don\u2019t like light beers, though.  But I need to watch my weight, so I try to mix some in every so often.  If you\u2019re in the same boat, this is better than Bud Light and Coors Light in terms of the \"health stats\" , and definitely has an edge in taste over the Bud Light (Close call with Coors Light).

The reason for this tasting is to prove beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that Miller Lite is the ultimate quaffable liquid. I think it\u2019s very humble of them to claim to be a \"True Pilsner\" on the front of their can. I like to think of it more as a true, genuine Bavarian Pilsener, steeped in a long history of an honest testament to only the finest ingredients combined with the most meticulous brewing procedures to produce God\u2019s gift to us in a tall boy can. PHASE 1: Both beers are at about 40 degrees and have been poured into their appropriate glasses. Oh, the MIller Lite is much better looking. The can is better looking even. It tells me up front that it only has 3.2g of *puke* carbs and only 96 calories in a serving. I shudder to think how many carbs Poseidon\u2019s Stout will pack onto my man hips. I might not even fit into my Girl Scout uniform if I drink dark beer like this all the time. The pulchritudinous pour of watery urine and a soapy head adorns my lager glass in a true display of aesthetics. The lovely aroma on this True Pilsner is heavy of soap, aluminum, dirty socks, and yummy diacetyl. Miller LIte wins phase 1 hands down. PHASE 2: mmmmm. After drinking that dark beer I had to clean my palate out with some tortilla chips just so I could detect anything in this fine lager. I mean, that stout tasted like coffee and stuff. yuk. MIller Lite delivers a thin, sparse mouthfeel with flavors of corn, cardboard, and a very remarkable amount of mineral water. This is almost unfair. Poor Poseidon\u2019s Stout isn\u2019t even in the same ballpark of a true, flavorful beer such as this award-winning pale. PHASE 3:Both beers will now sit and warm up to cellar temp and eventually even beyond that. This is obviously a stupid idea because real, true beer is meant to be consumed in an ice cold mug and poured out of a can that has been sitting in a giant tub of ice. Actually, I wish I could get all beer even colder than that, perhaps by using dry ice. Well, after waiting, I bring myself to consume this warm pale lager. Mmm. It\u2019s still delicious. More chemical notes are detectable now, kind of like toothpaste with baking soda. Paper and ink flavors are there. The finish would be harsh, but there it\u2019s so weak and watery that it can\u2019t really offend. So, what has this tasting shown me? What I already knew: Miller Lite is a real American brew that triumphs over all other lesser beers. This is further evidenced by these facts: Miller Lite sells a hell of a lot more beers than probably all of Fish Tale Ales\u2019 stuff combined. Miller endorses a NASCAR, Miller has a great taste, and is less filling.It comes in a can. I can get it at a baseball game.  And, of course, Miller Lite is about a fifth the cost of the Poseidon. This is what a True Pilsner is all about. \r\n\n\r\n[October 20, 2010]\r\n\n\r\nVortex Bottle best before January03, 2011. I hate this crap. A lot of craft beer drinkers complain about this stuff saying that it \"has no taste\" or it \"tastes like water\". Well, I wish that were entirely factual. The real problem is that it tastes like dirty seltzer water. It is a fair assessment to say it has very little flavor, but what flavor is here is disappointing. Imagine your favorite soda water. It\u2019s clean, bubbly, not much going on. Take that soda water and put in a few flakes of cheap cereal, a couple kernels of corn and the top off the cereal box. Voila! you have Miller Lite. Just barely enough flavor to offend.

Apparently, Pilsner Urquell has it all wrong, which is funny because they're owned by the same company.  D'oh!  Pale yellow. Strange, I was expecting a rich bronze.  After all, both Miller and Michael Jackson think that this is a pilsner.  Aroma of cardboard, DMS and plastic.  Since Jackson reckons this is a pilsner, and Miller says so themselves, I was kind of expecting a boatload of saaz or hallertau, punctuated by clean, refined continental pale malts.  Undaunted though, because the world's top beer writer thinks this and its ilk are pilsners, I must be the one who's wrong.  Now, I thought that maybe things would rectify themselves in the flavour and mouthfeel - you know, rich and hoppy, clean straw notes and a full rich body, leaving a lingering bitterness on the tongue.  Yet strangely, this pilsner is completely different - vague DMS and pretty much nothing else.
