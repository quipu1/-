She brought back a 330 mL can of San Miguel Pale Pilsen for me to try.\r\n\r\nThe San Miguel brewery has been around since 1890 and was once considered a world-class brewing operation. Now, however, it seems to have floundered in trying to settle for the bottom line. It\u2019s easily the largest brewery in the Phillipines and is said to have a 90+% market share in many southeast Asian countries. It also brews two truly abominable brews under liscense: Miller Genuine Draft and L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u.\r\n\r\nTo say that I had high expectations for this particular macro would be a lie. Nevertheless, I thought I\u2019d give it a chance.\r\n\r\nPleasant aromas filled the room the moment I cracked open the seemingly quaint 330 mL narrow-mouth can. Upon further investigation, the first aroma I picked up was decidedly metallic. I associated the aroma with brass. Beneath the metal, there was a generic citrus aroma that stymied all of my efforts to provide a more exact description. As the beer warmed up, a pleasant hint of mushroom started showing up.\r\n\r\nAs I poured the beer into a glass, a large head was raised. It dissipated almost completely within three minutes of pouring. The color was very pale, lighter than Mountain Dew when held up to a nearby lamp. Plenty of carbonation graced the beer, although it seemed to express itself with unusually large bubbles instead of a melange of smaller ones.\r\n\r\nThe flavor seemed light for a beer of 5% strength, and lacked a lot of qualities that I expect and enjoy in this style. Make no mistake about it: this beer is brewed in the international pils style, not the Czech-German pils tradition.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a light malty pils flavor that seems to run the gamut of the tongue and then stop on a time. I was impressed by this finesse and control. Many smashmouth brews have macho flavor experiences that could only dream of exacting such a precise blow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the pils style ought to be well hoped. It should have a crisp flavor brought on by the bitterness of hops and elaborated by perfuming hops. This beer, however, has no detectable hopping. It pretty much only plays its generic malt flavor, except for the occasional hint of mushroom or cranberry as the beer warms. The aftertaste is really where the good flavors are. There\u2019s a complex malty aftertaste that makes you want to sip it, which is difficult given the beer\u2019s quaffability.\r\n\r\nIf the ingredients list is to be trusted, this beer might actually have been brewed in the Reinheitsgebot tradition. It lists only malt, cereals, and hops. Upon examing their website, however, I doubt that the beer meets that standard of purity. Practically all brewers that adhere to the Reinheitsgebot boast about it online. That San Miguel makes no mention of the issue is evidence enough for me.\r\n\r\nFor all of its faults, this beer is extremely well balanced. The taste and the aftertaste are like sitting on a swing on a nice summer day. The direct malty flavor is elaborated upon by the complex malty aftertaste.", "writed_at": "August 15, 2006"}, {"user_id": "scanman", "beer_kor_name": "\uc0b0\ubbf8\uad6c\uc5d8\ud398\uc77c\ud544\uc820", "beer_eng_name": "San Miguel Pale Pilsen", "review_score": 3.0, "review_content": "A nice aroma.

See, my plan for beating jet lag was to figure out when it was 10 pm or so Taiwan time on the plane and pass out, so that I\u2019d be sleeping when I needed to be.

So the really cool Filipina stewardess, who was sympathetic to my problem, agreed to mix Crown and 7 for me and keep bringing them until I passed out.  Did I say I love Filipinas?  I don\u2019t remember how many it took, but before long I was snoozing while on the way to my promised land of Asian babes.  Two points for Chad!  So then I\u2019m in the Cathay Pacific lounge in Hong Kong at 7:00 am local time, and the plan from there was to drink caffeine, plunge through the day, and get a good night\u2019s rest before meeting my future boss for breakfast at 7:30 the next morning.  But, they had this stuff for free in the lounge and I can\u2019t say no to a beer I haven\u2019t rated.  And dude - the can I drank it out of had a freaking pull tab on it!
