Rather than tequila you can pick up lime, citric acid, alcohol artificial resin and pine (slight tequila traces in the background). Also not very pleasant metalic scents and even something like wet rag.\r\n  Clear golden colour with decent carbonation and nice fine-bubbly head which lasts long and leaves lacing .\r\n  When you taste it, you can taste tequila(unlikely when you just smell it). Also some lime, very strong citric acid, corn but the biggest problem is glucose syrup which makes it something closer to carbonated drinks rather than a beer and kills all the bitterness from the hop- you can only slightly pick it up in the aftertaste. Very light body, high artificial acidity with sticky texture(because of the mentioned glucose syrup). You can describe the  taste without a doubt as an 'artificial'. I think it used to be better(this is the reason of my good memories).\r\n  So why do I prefer Desperados to commercial lagers?

So Desperadoes is an interesting brew alright, one definitely to try. With an ABV of just under 6% giving it an added incentive.\r\n\r\nThe appearance isn\u2019t the best to be honest, pretty clear showing a golden orange colour with an initial decent frothy creamy head that dissipates quick enough. Some good lacing, but also dies soon after, looks like a lot of chemicals in this beer.\r\n\r\nThere is a very strong smell as you would expect ,very very sweet, like a fruit juice, mostly of citrus.\r\n\r\nThe taste has a very sweet and citrus taste to it, a bit tangy, tasting of lemon, lime and I guess Tequila. I say I guess because I\u2019m not so sure of you can pick up the taste of the tequila. There is also an interesting deep sour aftertaste.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that I have to say the beer isn\u2019t that bad. Once you get over the initial shock at all the sweet tastes, you do grow into it, and it does become a relatively smooth enough beer to drink. I think these beers would be a great accompaniment to a night on the town, perhaps have two or three to give you a little kick in your drinking during the night, or before you hit the clubs. Any more than that and I\u2019m not sure how they would go down. I don\u2019t think I could drink more than two or three to be honest. But overall its a good effort and I like the idea of Desperadoes. Have I found the taste of the tequila? Not sure, but then does it matter, the beer has a certain function which is to set you up for the party or the night, and this beer does that perfectly.
