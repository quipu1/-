Bought it in Ireland where our government dont trust us with strong alcohol. \n\nAlso from the bottle we can see that it is \u201cnamed after the 100 year old building where hops are still stored at St James Gate\u201d. \n\nLooks like a regular lager, small white head with a clear golden yellow colour. Head dies a little but does stick around a while.\n\nOverall it looks ok, not bad, looks nourishing!\n\nThe smell is strong enough, a real lagery smell on the nose, quite strong. I am getting fresh hops, citrus, with a good bit of passion fruits. Stronger on the nose than what a regular lager tends to be be. Promising!\n\nOn the taste found it very, very hoppy. Well it is called hop house, but wasn\u2019t expecting a \u201clager\u201d to be so bitter. More an IPA really than a regular lager, I guess that\u2019s all that double hopping then!!\nLagery taste on the fringes, the grainy malts there, but this is hop filled to the max. \n\nBit dry in the mouth too while very strong in the hops, otherwise can get the citrus and light malts. If I really want to taste all those hops in a lager then I will just order a regular IPA! \n\nHoppiness and that\u2019s about it really, otherwise a very bland beer from Guinness, at least from the bottle.  \n\nNo real character or flavour, it is a very weak effort as a lager to rival the big boys.

First thing of note is that it is a markedly different tasting beer dependent upon how it is conditioned. This canned version presents a golden colour with little to no head. The aroma is citrus driven, but unusually, this has jammy and raspberry notes. Thin mouthfeel that is slightly drying. Very drinkable lager.

Off-white, creamy, fairly thick head leaving large amounts of papery lacing over a cristal clear orangey-hued 'old gold' robe with no visible sparkling, darker than average for the intended style. Aroma of hot ironed cloth - in other words, very dominant pasteurisation, sourish grains and chicken food, damp kitchen towel, moist white pepper from your grandma's spice rack, potato peel, plastic, brown soap, new bicycle tyres, dried out bread crumbs and even a vague note of old dry rusk and soggy peanuts. Neutral onset, some sourish and (more pronounced) sweetish graininess, medium carbonation (quite softish for style actually), very slick, supple mouthfeel. Cereally, admittedly very thinly nutty middle - as in soggy breakfast cereals with a minimal dash of soaking wet peanuts thrown in - with that annoying cooked pasteurisation effect persisting all the way through, yet at the same time admittedly less grainy and more 'rounded' than is custom for an industrial pale lager. Ends only very mildly hoppy with vague floral and grassy notes, effectuating a very late, brief and superficial hop bitterness lingering a bit on the tongue's root but standing no chance against this ongoing blandness of cereally malt sweetishness; plastic- and cooked cloth-like accents as well. The aforementioned hoppiness, in all, remains very subtle and fails to lend the finish any body, rendering it thin and watery. Lazy marketing got the better of Guinness once again: this is a very bland, utterly boring pale lager like there are plenty enough around in the entire world, albeit - and I hate to admit it - perhaps a little bit more hop bitterish and a little bit maltier than average for the dreary yet still commercially dominant style it belongs to. Take note, Guinness executives: in a world where people are increasingly turning to 'craft beer', teach your marketeers not to put \"Hop House\" or anything else with the word \"hop\" on your label. This only creates confusion and disappointment, because what you present us with here, is a very cheaply made, bland and artificial pale lager - not at all smelling like 'peach' or 'apricot' like you seem to promise your consumers.
