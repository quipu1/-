Explosive five finger head with soapy white foam which last for 4 minutes; Poor sticky lacing with very fizzy carbonation.\n\nAroma: Fragrant Ale malt, with strong peach soda, yellow fruits, light perfume, floral petals, strong sugar, spice, strong sweet bread and lemon.\n\nTaste: Medium sweet fair Ale malt, with fair wheat, light tartness, peach, apricots, yellow fruits, floral, moderate sugar, light spice, strong herbs, bread, lemon peels, fair bitter hops and strong grass.\n\nBody: Mid to light body. Slightly slick palate.\n\nMouth Feel: Fair Ale maltyness in a wheat-thinned background. \nNotable peach not as conspicuous as the aroma, with moderate apricots and yellow fruit hops abound. Flowery with fair sweetness, very herbal and grassy with lemon peels to round. Okay but awkward.\n\nHoppiness: Yellow fruits, light perfume, floral petals, spice and lemon in nose. Apricots, yellow fruits, floral, light spice, strong herbs, lemon peels and strong grass in taste; Bitterness is fair for an abrupt, mid-to-low level bitter light Ale malty finish.\n\nAfter Taste: Quite dry. Herbal wheaty and quite easy to mouth.\tI \n\nComments: I am a bit put off by this one\u2018s strong but artificial peach and sweet bread aroma, but its taste is a fairly decent combination of strong herbs, mild fruity hops and lemon peels, if only not being spoiled by the (again) unreal peach taste. What would be a potentially nice summer ale if only the brewer use real peach or strong dose of peachy tropical hops.

The importer said that they no longer imported it any more. Pours a cloudy yellowish amber with a two finger white head; nice peachy smell accompanied by some floral hoops and malt. Very nice nose! Taste of an artificial fruit flavour, and a little bit of hops to balance it. Not that sweet, but the strange flavour didn't do this beer any favours.
