Thin but slick palate; Mouth feel is seriously rice-thinned black Lager - actually good maltyness in a rather slick and not so thin body, strongly roasted and nutty. Loads of rice but quite smooth throughout, not the raw grainy stuff from those cheapo macro Pales. Notable light black coffee and caramel fill up the palate. No sweetness, not very \u2018Dry\u2019. Close to the Schwarz style but very dour and lacking. Hmm\u2026 Hoppiness is thin grass in nose, light lemon and strawy grass in taste. Bitterness was moderately strong for a lasting,\r\nlight astringent finish; Fairly dry after taste; Roasty and light bitter to mouth.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: This one feels like the regular Super Dry with dark malt as direct replacement. It more or less emulates the light black beer quite well, albeit artificially because of the rice. Not as dry and crisp as the Super Dry proper, it still worth a chug for a relaxing evening.
