Slick palate; Mouth feel is more like a Radler - half ricey macro Pale and half mango juice, which is so strong you can\u2019t taste any residual hops from the cheap Hite beer. Sugary sweet, but fruit-wise it taste much stronger than most mango-themed fruit beers. Sorta okay\u2026 No hoppiness or bitterness whatsoever, just sweet juicey finish; Wet after taste. Very easy to mouth.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: The overload of mango - real or not - in aroma and taste gives the pretty cheap Hite beer base a spark, so this is not much a fruit beer, more like a beer-juice mix, could have been good if only sweetness can be toned down.", "writed_at": "September 14, 2016"}, {"user_id": "conquerex", "beer_kor_name": "\ub9dd\uace0 \ub9c1\uace0", "beer_eng_name": "Mango Lingo", "review_score": 3.0, "review_content": "\ub9e5\uc8fc\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uce75\ud14c\uc77c\uc5d0 \uac00\uae5d\ub2e4. \uadf8\uac83\uc774 \uc758\ub3c4\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc798 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub984 \ubc14\uce89\uc2a4\ub97c \uac14\uc744 \ub54c, \uc220\uc744 \uc798 \ub9c8\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub294 \ubabb\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubd84\uc704\uae30\ub97c \ub9de\ucd94\uba70 \uc220 \ud55c\uc794\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc815\ub9d0 \uc88b\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub9e5\uc8fc\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uacfc\uc77c\ud5a5\uacfc \ub2e8 \ub9db\uc744 \uaebc\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\uae30 \ud798\ub4e4\ub2e4. \uac00\ubccd\uac8c \uc990\uae30\ub294 \uc790\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc808\ud558\ub2e4.", "writed_at": "August 26, 2016"}]
