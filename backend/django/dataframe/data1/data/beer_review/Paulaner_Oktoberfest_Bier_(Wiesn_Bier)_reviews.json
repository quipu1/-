It\u2019s lightly grassy, but just isn\u2019t working for me. The flavor is incredibly sweet and metallic. The breads just control and the sweet graininess is really interesting.

Some breweries makes different brews of the same style but don\u2019t differentiate them in the marketing so I sometimes never know which beers I\u2019ve had and which I haven\u2019t. Case in point: Paulaner Oktoberfest Wiesn \u2013 which, despite the name is not a wheat beer (\u201cwiesn\u201d apparently means fair \u2013 the event, not the sense of justice). This has been around for years and apparently I\u2019ve never had it before. Not that I was missing much as this is a pretty standard pale lager with no frills. I\u2019m wondering if this is truly considered an Oktoberfest/Marzen brew.\r\n\n\n\r\nI poured an 11.2oz bottle into a mug. It had a best before date of 6/16. \n\n\r\n\r\nAppearance: Dark golden color with crystal clarity. Some carbonation bubbles can be seen trickling up. Pours to a two-finger, off-white, soapy head which mostly evaporates and leaves little lacing.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Not much of anything other than the generic pale lager scent. I do detect a faint green apple character.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: People tend to like Oktoberfestbiers better than regular pale lagers since they tend to have a little bit of actual flavor to them, but not so much that it\u2019s overwhelming. In the case of this one I\u2019m surprised it bears the Oktoberfest name because it seems like any other pale lager. I don\u2019t detect any adjunct presence, but I don\u2019t get any discernible malt or hop character, either. This seems like a rather boring lager to me. I will say it\u2019s sweeter than the average lager, though; I notice a mild caramel sweetness, but that\u2019s about it. Just a faint dry bitterness on the backend. It finishes clean, which is nice. That\u2019s about it.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: I\u2019m surprised to see the label on the bottle mentions a potency of 6% ABV. I thought Oktoberfest biers were supposed to be fairly nominal in weight since they\u2019re intended for sessioning? This beer does not seem to be nearly that strong as the palette is mild and direct. The actual deliver of Paulaner Oktoberfest Wiesn is a little boring, too. The mouthfeel is not as crisp and bubbly as most pale lagers. I would not consider it refreshing, either. At least it goes down smooth and leaves almost no aftertaste. \r\n\n\n\r\nRATING: 5/10", "writed_at": "September 4, 2015"}, {"user_id": "Jenner707", "beer_kor_name": "\ud30c\uc6b8\ub77c\ub108 \uc625\ud1a0\ubc84\ud398\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub9e5\uc8fc", "beer_eng_name": "Paulaner Oktoberfest Bier (Wiesn Bier)", "review_score": 3.0, "review_content": "Light clear amber color with little white head.

The beer is a nice gold hue that shows an almost brilliantly clear, bright gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of tin-like hops, soft doughy malt, some dried-grassy-cracker like grain character, perhaps a hint of lemon like hops that mix with a touch of honey like malt character.  As the beer warms the herbal / lemon zest honey notes become more noticeable. \n\n\r\n\r\nCrisp and cold, straight from the food fridge, this has a nice bitter hop bite to it and a dry malt character helps accentuate this.  This finishes with a pretty nice pale malt note that reminds me of pale grain crackers, a touch something that reminds me of dried barley still in the field, and even a touch of something that reminds me of a lemon / herbal honey that adds just a touch of spice to the finish.  Actually the hop character, while not over the top, perfumes the entirety of each sip and melds quite well with the pale malt character.  This is nicely quaffable (as a beer meant to drink by the liter should be), but does have some body to it; so it isn\u2019t like a Helles.\n\n\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty clean lager that drinks like a slightly amped up Helles; this is definitely a good thing and I am definitely enjoying the interesting pale malt character and the herbal \u2013 lemon honey character that comes from the mix of malt and hops.
