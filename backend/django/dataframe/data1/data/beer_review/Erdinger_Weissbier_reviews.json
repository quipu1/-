If you want wheat in your wheat beer, this delivers, with the hops, normally perhaps quite noticeable for a weissbier, here having their work cut out to shine a light through the thickness of body, and just about managing, cutting through every so often when needed. If you've had weissbiers and thought they didn't deliver the wheat, Erdinger has you covered here. Thick, almost frothy mouthfeel. Only hints of that classic banana yeast though, likewise for the other fruity flavours that a really good weissbier can show - they're there, just about, but this one's really wheat-focused. Lovely, thick, creamy and smooth, especially when the carbonation dies down a little.

The head is a three finger white shade with that has a foamy appearance to it. Retention is really nice, too.\r\n\r\nS: Not only are the typical banana/clove estery aromas lacking here...so is just about anything else. About the only thing I really notice is a mild cherry-like sweetness and the faintest hint of wheat. Not really a bad aroma - after all, how can a nose so weak be considered bad?\r\n\r\nT: Well, the aroma suggested a feeble flavor, and that\u2019s what I got. While the lack of weizen esters allows the opening wheat quality and finishing noble hops to shine through more strongly, it really drinks like a dinky-ass US wheat ale (think Widmer Hefeweizen) than a proper German hefeweizen. Okay, so a slight banana presence builds up after a few sips, but by then it\u2019s too little, too late. Just a boring beer in all flavor aspects.\r\n\r\nM: The texture does a good job of staying out the way of the lack of flavor by finishing with a mildly clean dryness to it. I could do without the budding wet, syrupy linger, but I\u2019ll certainly give it points for being refreshing and crisp.\r\n\r\nO: A score this low would suggest a mediocre-to-poor effort riddled with flaws - however this isn\u2019t actually flawed, just devoid of any good weizen characteristics...or any characteristics for that matter.

Hoegaarden is personally responsible for a drunken 3am phone call to my dear mum from one of my friends, demanding that I personally come too reception and open the front door. Woops, wrong number...\n\nFast forward two weeks from this incident, and after a week of drinking the white nectar by the firkin, I discover that exists several variants of wheat beer, including a large supply of German examples of hefenweizen in the nearby tesco\u2019s.\n\nErdinger holds pride of place as the first example of German wheat beer I ever tried, and frankly have never looked back since. \n\nPouring a beautiful off cream approaching a slightly golden hue, Erdinger produces a mighty head which shakes hands with the nostrils on first sip, and absolutely sticks around fr the party. \n\nBanana bread, slight hint of cloves, and a subtle but wonderful waft of sweet weetabix, Erdinger is not particularly forthcoming in its nasal charms (not exactly surprising given the fifteen foot of mousse floating on top), however the taste buds start atinglin\u2019 once the volatiles finally punch through. \n\nIn the tasting, again the suggestion of cloves banana bread comes through, backed by a ever so slightly citric acidity and a rich, malty sweetness similar to Horlicks. It is a flavour profile I can only describe as the equivalent to a beer version of a cup of Ovaltine, giving a rich satisfying feeling of well being, while at the same time extremely thirst quenching. Essentially a smile in a pint glass.\n\nOn the palette, Erdinger has just the right balance between creamy richness and fizzy refreshment to give that fabulous thirst quenching characteristic wheat beers pull off with such ease and grace. One word to the wise however, the slice of orange is not particularly recommended in weizens...the Belgian examples might have adjuncts that work well with the citrus, but the Teutonic example works best alone.\n\nHappy sipping!", "writed_at": "February 2, 2013"}, {"user_id": "nedchristie", "beer_kor_name": "\uc5d0\ub529\uac70 \ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\ube44\uc5b4", "beer_eng_name": "Erdinger Weissbier", "review_score": 4.1, "review_content": "This is a delight to imbibe.

Quite slick and slighty creamy palate.\r\n\r\n\n\nMouth Feel: Strong lager base, wheatyness is much less than most Weissbiers with very little tartness. Tends towards a wheat lager. Caramel, fruity ester, cloves and spices are notably lower, yet ther are some creaminess and (relatively) strong hops to compensate. Okay.\r\n\r\n\n\nHoppiness: Light lemon and quite fresh grassy hops in nose and taste. Bitterness is weiss low-fi, but quite notable - lager style - for a mostly malty and grassy low bitter finish.\r\n\r\n\n\nAfter Taste: Fairly dry. Quite creamy and malty to mouth.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: So a re-rate gives me a better idea of Erdinger\u2019s weiss brewing: from the lowly \u2018Champ\u2019 to this flagship Weissbier, they opted for more barley than wheat for a lager-ish palate and universal appeal. For easy drinking that\u2019s okay, but what so less wheat to signify the traditional Weissbier style, this is below standard. Drinkable and not something to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\n\nOriginal review on 6-Feb-2013:\r\n\r\n\n\nCloudy hazy gold in appearance. Medium body with cloudy good foam and lasting thick white head; Taste is quite hoppy, with strong yeast taste reminds me of roast duck (!) Smell is slight grassy; Fresh and quite rich palate, hop bitterness is slight, very easy to mouth, with a filling aftertaste.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: I like this better than Bocq\u2019s Blanche de Namur ( I know, they are different style) but not as earthy and hearty as Frankiskaner Weissbier Naturtrub. Still, it\u2019s solid and not flashy.

Even though they conform to the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516, beers of this style tend to be extremely robust and complex and yet highly drinkable and land on \"Best of\" lists all the time. \n\nHowever, to use an analogy my friend Henry coined - even Ivy League schools still have C students and Erdinger Hefe-Weizen is the beer equivalent of that. \n\nI poured a 500ml bottle into a 20oz wheat beer glass.\n\nAppearance: Surprisingly bright banana-yellow hue. Body is crystal-clear until the yeast is added (most hefeweizens tend to be at least a little cloudy at first). It forms a huge, bright white, soapy head which fizzles away like a soda leaving no lacing on the glass at all. This is also unusual, as most other hef\u2019s heads tend to be frothy and dirty up the glass with lacing all the way down.\n\nSmell: I was actually shocked to detect a noticeable skunky aroma at first, but it seemed to diminish after only a few swigs. This could be due to the fact the bottle is a very light shade of brown - almost olive green, in fact. There\u2019s a slight floral and lemon scent which is pleasing, but not strong enough to overpower the skunk.\n\nTaste: While the appearance and aroma were not what I would consider favorable, my first swig of Erdinger Hefe-Weizen helped me remember why I love beers of this style. The initial taste of the foamy head and the top of the palate was sweet, almost creamy, and definitely refreshing. Lemon is the most noticeable flavor here, which, combined with the head, is sweeter than usual and makes for a lemon meringue pie taste.\n\nUnfortunately, I judge beer on its entire performance, not just first impressions, and this beer begins to run out of steam quickly. Once the head dissipates the creamy texture and taste is lost and a palate of generic spice begins to take hold. It\u2019s more of an allspice and pepper flavor with even a lager-like grainy effect. The sourness from the smell begins to make itself known in the palate and gives it a bit of tang. The lemon flavor still hangs in there, keeping this beer from tilting the scales from good to bad, but hangs right on the fulcrum of average.\n\nDrinkability: Although there are definite flaws to this beer, it at least functions as the bare minimum of a refreshing wheat beer. Mouthfeel is on the lower end of medium with some crispness at first and tepid thinness later on it. Some spices dance on the tongue and linger, but are expected from this style. \n\nOverall, a disappointing beer considering the brewery and country of origin.

That was quite a few years ago, and since then I have supped many an authentic German hefeweizen and many an equal German-style hefeweizen. In that time inbetween, I never revisited the Erdinger Hefeweizen, that is, until now. A few weeks prior, I brought home a bottle of Erdinger to see if memories are indeed sepia-colored and all is not as I remember.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nA slow pour reveals pale straw, hay, and yellowish hues rather unassuming for a German hefeweizen. Near the end of the bottle, I make sure to swirl the last little bit vigorously along the bottom to gather up any yeasty dregs of delight that have settled. One last pour and a creamy white head greets skeptical eyes. This is one of the lightest German hefeweizens I have gazed upon, and as I partake of her nose, one of the lesser aromatic ones also. Very mild, I dig deep to search for any endearing characteristics. Eventually I unearth lemon cream, raw meringue, and white bread flowing underneath a meager showing of clove and banana. I happen to be a huge fan of robust German hefeweizens, and at this very moment, I am none-too-impressed. It\u2019s proven science that our nose can detect far more in aroma and thusly flavor than our tastebuds can, so such a faint nose does not bode well for her palate. After a couple generous quaffs I have come to the distinct conclusion that I am in for a whole lot of nothing. A very light mouthfeel and body is matched perfectly by a very light array of hefeweizen flavors. Mild banana bread puffs in the finish while the middle is mild banana cream topped with old cloves and raw whipped meringue. Digging deeper, lemon cake joins her shadowy brethren with equal despair. Wholly underwhelming, I still finish the Erdinger Hefeweizen because, while she may be weak-willed and mild-mannered, she is far from a drain-pour.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nMemories are indeed most endearing when lingering in the sepia recesses of one\u2019s mind, at least, in regards to Erdinger, but at the same time, it was nice to revisit one of the progenitors of my destined journey.

Like most wheat beers, the bottle has a layer of sediment at the bottom leading me to speculate that this beer is likely unfiltered, unpasteurized, and carbonated in the bottle. This sediment is common in German and other European beers and being unpasteurized with live yeast in there would allow the beer to really show its true colors as I see it.

The first was a translucent, sparkling, pale gold with a large amount of long-lasting bubbling. The second was a hazy, cloudy, golden tan that succeeds in making the liquid largely opaque. It looked a bit like apricot nectar in the glass. Both pours produced a large amount of tight, uneven, near-white head. Both pours smelled and tasted roughly the same. \r\n\r\nThe flavor is dominated by lemon sourness. It is not a gross sourness, but it is not particularly tasty either.

I Was pleasantly surprised that it was no more costly than all the other brews in my beer store.  The cost was just $2 for a brown 11.2 oz bottle.  Gently pouring the beer into my mug, it first looks like any other ubiquitous clear pale yellow american beer.  Then comes the aesthetic impression; near the bottom of the pour the yeast starts to make its appearance.  Swirling, hypnotizing clouds and particles of yeast. Now the brew is cloudy like I expect from a good hefe.  The aroma is that of uncooked bread dough and citrus, perhaps lemons. No head on this brew but there is a constant stream of rising carbonation from within the brew.  The commencement on the tongue is pleasurable, it is well behaved and nonoffensive.  Beautiful above average carbonation greets the back of your throat. The taste is much better than troegs dream weaver and penns weizen.  Very little if any bitterness can be detected in this smooth tasting brew.  Not much similarity to the american lager, tho very gentlemanlike in its flavors.

The palpable splendor of meats, fruits, vegetables and of course sweets is simply too much for all the rices, oats, barleys and other grains out there that require time and temperance to be molded into something edible.  It\u2019s true, grains need to be processed, but when they\u2019re done right they make the very fabric of our culinary culture.  They\u2019re old, tried and true, and for that reason they\u2019re none too fashionable, but I think it\u2019s that reliability that makes them the premier of the comestible world.  Sure, there is stuff like quinoa which by the only merit of having been untried makes it cool (even though it\u2019s like chewing on dried pine needles and toe nail clippings) but we\u2019re not talkin\u2019 yuppy feed.  We\u2019re talking about staples and the stuff that built civilization.  From that blessed and humble germ we made beer.  It was a monument to the grasses that sustained us (and no, not the recreational kind) and it was good.  It made men happy.  And from that drink we refined it to be an even cleaner, more chiseled testament to grain: the Hefe-Weizen.  Wheat incarnate in a drink, it epitomized the savory and the sweet.  But only if treated properly.  And sadly, the Erdinger attempt strays too far from that arcane ritual which produces exquisite Hefe-Weizen beer.  At its best I expect something replete with a well mannered wheatiness, plentiful banana esters and a good touch of vanilla.  In the Erdinger there is a dominant fuzzy palate that eclipses most of the flavors, which include a collection familiar to any household garbage can.  Stale apples, iron, cardboard, sawdust, a marzen-esque taste and weak nutmeg all work together towards a soft and flimsy palate.  It sounds like it should be wretched and offensive but en totale it\u2019s a simple issue of failing to impress.  This golden drink bears some relation to its primordial plant form, but I\u2019d expect it to ascend to a higher level of being after so much working and reworking of its inner carbohydrates, sugars and proteins.  So much work should produce at least some benefit, but I\u2019d rather roll the grain and chaff around my hand and ponder on its meaning symbolism than give this botched beer another try.", "writed_at": "October 15, 2007"}, {"user_id": "bochi23", "beer_kor_name": "\uc5d0\ub529\uac70 \ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\ube44\uc5b4", "beer_eng_name": "Erdinger Weissbier", "review_score": 2.4, "review_content": "Bottle.

I don\u2019t really like that characteristic in my beer. This one does not go overkill on that; it does have that hint of banana but it is buried and subtle. This is incredibly sweet. WOW. It is sugar wheat sugar wheat sugar sugar wheat. It made me think instantly of sweet bread. I poured this slowly into my Weizen Glass, being careful not to include the yeast and sediment. On to the breakdown:\r\n\r\nAppearance: Nice pale yellow with a hint of orange, huge sudsy head. Lots of tiny carbonation bubbles lasted the duration of the beer showing how active it is.\r\n\r\nSmell: Sugar, wheat, vanilla, and just a hint of banana.\r\n\r\nTaste: This is so amazingly sweet I was surprised. Wheat, malt, vanilla, banana and a variety of fruits are things I could pull out in this very well blended and balanced flavor. There is just a hint of hops in the crisp dry swallow. \r\n\r\nMouthfeel &amp; Drinkability: Wheat beers tend to be thin in my experience but this was not too thin. The sugar element along with the carbonation, helped it fill out into a satisfying medium body beer. It is very lightweight in your mouth and in your stomach. This makes it very easy to keep drinking more. I never had Erdinger Hefe-Weizen before, but for some reason I got 2 bottles. I just finished the second while writing this review, (I should have gotten a six-pack). Obviously a refreshing, drinkable beer. \r\n\r\nHope this is helpful.\r\nCheers!", "writed_at": "September 6, 2006"}, {"user_id": "DarkMagus", "beer_kor_name": "\uc5d0\ub529\uac70 \ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\ube44\uc5b4", "beer_eng_name": "Erdinger Weissbier", "review_score": 2.8, "review_content": "Nice yeasty and hoppy aroma with a hint of roasted grains and malt to it.

Pours a hazy copper-goldenrod color.  Slightly muted in tone, not as shimmering and light-tinted as the style demands, I believe.  The head is initially large and fluffy (white), well-retained, but lacking any lacing.  Carbonation is seemingly low, and only sparse bubbles rise lazily to the surface.  Aroma:  Very dry wheat.  Creamy, lightly biscuity, with white sourdough and just a faint pinch of lemon juice.  Bananas are noticeable, but are weak and drowned out in the strong yeast dryness and even stronger wheat dryness.  Just bland and doughy.  No lively bubblegum, clove or citrus zest and no trace of any honey-like malts.  A touch salty and rather stale smelling.  Very weak in strength as well.  Flavor seems to confirm that this bottle is either A) much passed its prime (though it is still within in the best before date) or B) not a well-made weisse.  I\u2019d hope to think the former.  The low carbonation seems to be a good indicator that perhaps this has been heated too much at some point and sat out for too long a period of time.  Doughy, lightly grainy malts are briefly sweet, but passing completely to a strong wheat creaminess in texture brought on by a huge dry wheat flavor.  Bit more of saltiness/seltzer water.  Sponge bread, hint of bananas and lemons.  No clove, hops or bubble gum and the mouthfeel is sluggish, the texture loose.  No alcohol apparency.  Would like to try a fresher bottle for sure.  4/4/5/2/8\nDraught weizen glass at Beacon Street Pub. on 6/22/07\nMuch improved, so I\u2019m going to change the rating to reflect this experience.  Must have been too old a bottle previously.  This still showed a golden-hay colored body with a moderate amount of head, light lacing.\nWheaty with soft honey, lemon and light bubble gum.  Not your typical blast of bubble gum or clove and not all that doughy or yeasty (in terms of actual yeast blandness, not ester production).  Probably filtered and then redosed with yeast?  I dont know.  The flavor was fairly estery, but without any real acidity/doughiness, and mostly a chewy, hay-like flavor from the wheat and barley.
