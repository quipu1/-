They are aesthetically pleasing, with nice contours and a heavy-duty feel in your hand. Even the pull tab is satisfying as it punctures the aluminum construction. Opening it seems to take the force of a trigger pull on a firearm. Does the can matter? Well, it might invite you to buy the beer as it does for me. But let me now focus on the liquid within. Appearance is light copper or clear amber. Carbonation quickly releases some white fizzy head which rapidly disappeared. Aroma is light cereal, grain, earthy with some minor floral notes. Basically, you're getting a lot of bread and biscuit malt with this one. I would have liked for it to be less watered down and more amped up with stronger malts. It's not bad, just don't be expecting Delirium Tremens quality. Style-wise, it is similar to DT as it is very malt-forward. The beer seems to emphasize its fine European ingredients, which I thought was odd for a Japanese beer company. Overall this is a nice sipper, with a light palate.

The label states that this beer is brewed with \"the finest barley and European hops\". That is not surprising, German brewers were sent to Japan in the latter half of the 19th Century to teach the Japanese how to brew beer. This Germanic influence can be seen today in Japanese beer styles, most notably in \"black beer\", a German style of dark lager that has survived in Japan, and is still being brewed there to this day.(see my review of Sapporo Stout for details.) Sapporo Reserve is not a schwarzbier, but is more along the lines of a malty German helles, bordering on maibock. \r\n\r\nSapporo Reserve pours to a beautiful, bright, golden color with a nice white head, and a lively carbonation. The nose on this beer is very enjoyable. Really nice aromas of malt marry with some grassy hop aromatics. The palate is firm, good pale malt flavors are round and clean on the tongue. This beer finishes with more good malt character and is balanced with some good, dry hop bitterness. This is a very balanced beer. The label states \"malt liquor\", which translates that its abv is higher, I\u2019m guessing around 6-7% avb. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed this beer very much, it reminded me of a good malty helles style beer poured at Oktoberfest in Germany, or even a Maibock.
