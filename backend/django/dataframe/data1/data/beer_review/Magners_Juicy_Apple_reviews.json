Got a tall can for about one US dollar. Not very carbonated, which I liked. Not very much alcohol taste. It had a little bit of an apple vinegar aftertaste but that's present with almost all ciders. Better than Somersby's which just tastes like juice to me.", "writed_at": "March 25, 2021"}, {"user_id": "GoufCustom", "beer_kor_name": "\ub9e4\uadf8\ub108\uc2a4 \uc96c\uc2dc \uc560\ud50c", "beer_eng_name": "Magners Juicy Apple", "review_score": 2.6, "review_content": "330 ml bottle with pull-tap bought via Ztore.\r\n\r\n\n\nClear very pale golden colour; One-quarter finger head with residual soapy white foam which fades in 10 seconds; No lacing with active carbonation; Tart aroma of light apple wine, with yoghurt, dry white wine, fair apple flesh, alcohol and tannin; Mid to strong sweet taste of apple juice, with light alcohol, strong carbo, soda, light apple flesh and sugar; Light body. Watery palate; Mouth feel is thinned, soda-ish and sweet apple juice with straight booze, no wineyness, no tartness nor tannin. Nah!... Fairly dry after taste. Very easy to mouth.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: This is considerably better than the characterless Magners Original Cider, with notable sweetness and some fleshy apple added to it. As a sweet cider, however, this is way short of the vibrant Nomandy sweet ciders. For casual drinking only.", "writed_at": "October 21, 2018"}]
