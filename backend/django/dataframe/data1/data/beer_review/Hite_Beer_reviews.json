A cheap bottle from BeerWulf. It's summer. Why not? Drunk fridge cold straight from the bottle it quenches the thirst, which is all it is meant to do. It is a big standard global lager with little flavour, but then it's not intended to have flavour. Sigh. It's boring, but drinkable. Next... [2.1]\r\n\r\nJuly 2003.  Bottle. The brewery uses \"new rhythm\" technology - which essentially means they lower the heat slowly between fermentation and storage resulting in a cheap nasty taste. The Shite.
