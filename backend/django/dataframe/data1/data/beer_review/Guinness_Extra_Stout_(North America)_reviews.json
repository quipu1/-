Upon pouring there is a huge tan head that has quite good persistence. The head fades slowly over time to give a great level of lacing on the sides of the glass.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The aroma is heaviest of roasted coffee and some dark chocolate with notes of a lighter caramel and vanilla sweetness. Rather nice.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste starts out of a good balance between a roasted malt and coffee flavor as well as a lighter caramel sweetness. Some light vanilla comes to the tongue, but overall the sweetness lessens as the taste goes on. Toward the end the roastier flavors begin coming more and more pronounced with the sweet fading more and more. In the end a slightly bitter roasted flavor is left on the tongue. While not bad, the aftertaste is a little too biting and the transitions a little too abrupt/harsh.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is on the average side with the carbonation level quite average as well. For the roastier flavors a thicker and creamier body would have been better. Also while not unpleasant a lighter carbonation would have helped for the darker roastier flavors as well.\r\n\r\n Overall - The beer overall looks and smells great, and initially tastes fantastic. The very bitey aftertaste and the somewhat un-flattering mouthfeel however bring it down. Overall it is not bad, but not fantastic either.

A rocky tan head bubbles up considerably and takes a while to subside.\r\n\r\nRoasted malt, raisins, chocolate sweetness, and molasses are all present in the nose. Maybe a hint of spice and light bitterness from a nuanced hop presence.\r\n\r\nThe flavor matches up with the aroma. The start is sweet molasses, heavily roasted or burnt malt, chocolate, and raisins. Light coffee leads to a lightly spiced hops. It finishes with some sweetness that ties the flavor together nicely.\r\n\r\nThis feel actually has some body to it. After drinking the Draught, though, maybe anything would feel thick and bold.

Licorice root and licorice sticks meddle in his roasted barley affair, and a few snuffs later reveal nothing new. My first quaff is smooth with a good clean mouthfeel, albeit dry of course. Raw barley, cracked barley, and toasty whole grain crust settles atop the center of my tongue for the duration of our tasting session. Short in the front and short in the finish, the whole of his palate sits squarely in the middle. Chewy and earthy licorice root mingles with black earth while burnt cracked barley dries the top of my tongue. Burnt caramel is a feeble whisper.

But what about Guinness Extra Stout? Is it the same beer in a different bottle or is it truly a beer on its own? I decided to find out.\n\nPOUR, COLOR AND AROMA\n\nThe main difference between Guinness Extra Stout and Draught in the home version is this beer is missing the nitrogen widget which creates the lively body of sinking bubbles it would have on tap. Extra Stout pours and looks like a porter \u2013 extremely smooth and seemingly lightweight. It forms a soda-like, tan head which quickly fizzles out and leaves virtually no lacing on the glass (quite the opposite of the Draught). \n\nIt\u2019s actually quite easy to tell this beer is very dark maroon/brown in color, although at just an arm length\u2019s away it appears to be opaque black. The aroma is surprisingly subdued as well, since the scent is very weak. It doesn\u2019t have the obvious bitter aroma of the Draught; in fact, it has a mild, malty scent with just the slightest bit of hop to the nose.\n\nTASTE\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of porters at all, but I do like black lagers or \u201cschwarzbiers\u201d as they\u2019re traditionally referred to. I was curious if Guinness Extra Stout would taste like either of these beers since it has the visual qualities of both. I was relieved upon taking my first taste to discover it is very reminiscent of a black lager. \n\nThe flavor was much like the aroma: very mild. Guinness on tap tends to have a bitter, chocolate and coffee-like taste, but Extra Stout drinks more like a traditional lager. It did have a sweet, buttery taste that wasn\u2019t dry in the least and only slightly bitter. I probably would have preferred something stronger-tasting but it definitely satisfied me.\n\nFINISH\n\nAside from the taste, the other noticeable characteristic that sets Extra Stout apart from Draught is the super smooth finish. Whereas the Draught has a heavier body and a stronger, bitterer taste it tends to have a bit of bite to its finish. Not so with this beer as it goes down like flat soda. \n\nBODY\n\nIf you just mention the name Guinness to Joe and Jane Six Pack they tend to scoff to the extent of how thick and heavy the beer is. While this is true of the Draught (and part of what makes it so good), the Extra Stout is surprisingly light.\n\nAt only 5% ABV and having a very thin, light body (probably under 140 calories), this drinks like any run-of-the-mill lager, only smoother. I drank two bottles without feeling full or buzzed in the least. It would make a great compliment to a meal or work well as an after-dinner reward.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nGuinness Extra Stout was nothing like what I expected, so I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be such a tasty, smooth dark lager. I\u2019m surprised Guinness doesn\u2019t market this beer more aggressively, especially for the American mass-market lager drinker who wants something smooth and light. Whatever, I still like it. \n\nNOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yRmv2mDC94", "writed_at": "February 28, 2010"}, {"user_id": "kp", "beer_kor_name": "\uae30\ub124\uc2a4 \uc5d1\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub77c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc6b0\ud2b8(\ubd81\ubbf8)", "beer_eng_name": "Guinness Extra Stout (North America)", "review_score": 2.9, "review_content": "Name: Guinness Extra Stout\n\nBrewery: St James Gate (Guinness)\n\nDate: January 03, 2010\n\nMode: Bottle\n\nSource: Tasting, Cellar Ticker\n\nAppearance: balck, fine beige head, streaks of lace\n\nAroma: sweet roasted malt aroma, sweet caramel, touch of milky sweetness\n\nFlavor: dry roasted malt flavor, touch of bitter dark chocolate, lots of burnt malt bitterness, long bitter finish\n\nOverall: overly burnt\n\nAroma: 6/10; Appearance: 7/10; Flavor: 5/10; Palate: 6/10; Overall: 11/20\n\nRating: 2.9/5.0\nDrinkability: 7/10\n\nScore: ** /4", "writed_at": "February 20, 2010"}, {"user_id": "bpreo", "beer_kor_name": "\uae30\ub124\uc2a4 \uc5d1\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub77c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc6b0\ud2b8(\ubd81\ubbf8)", "beer_eng_name": "Guinness Extra Stout (North America)", "review_score": 3.7, "review_content": "Where traditional Guinness tastes like a candied smoothie, Guinness Extra Stout tastes like beer.

Not much better in aroma than the draught, but way better in the flavor and palate. Much fuller flavor and less one-sided in flavor. A pretty good dry stout.\r\nTECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown. It was a little lighter than the draught. Ther was a huge off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was light to moderate dark bread, raste, chocolate and coffee malts. Also none of the witch hazel aroma I noticed in the draught.

Labat makes the fermilar Local Guinness E.S.  by adding said wort  to a plae ale, and Guinness Canada {a small brewier in nova scotia} adds yeast and water to properly brew the stout. The guinness canada one is normaly exported exclusivley to the US, but for some {prpbably illegal} reason, I found a store with it here. This is probably the best dry stout I have ever had. Pours a jet black with a heavy dose of small carbonation bubbles, thin whispy coffie with cream head, quickly disapating, minimal lacenings. Aroma is coffie, sugar cane, and noble bitter hops. Palat is smooth and silky with a light dry finish. Taste is what it\u2019s all about, cryin of irelen. Full flavour like there isn\u2019t room to disove any more. Sweet dark chocolate malt, red ruby pumb malt, and roasted barley dancing with a very noble blend of earthy bitter hops. undertones of grapfruit, acidic tones, a slight sour bite, yellow plumb, green apple and a sweet burnt sugar finish. Robust after taste, nutty and sweet with a finaly of deep full mild bitterness. Gaz returns {burps} taste of roasted nut and dark chocolate. This is amasing. I must tell people about this discovery.

Ok, Pours black with whispy large bubbled head, quickly fades. Light carbonation,  Malty nose, some nuttyness. Thick mouthfeel {somtimes slimy if it\u2019s not fresh} Black Malt flavour, roasted barley, smoke, mild sweet caramel, and just the right amount of bitter hop to smoth it all out. Aftertaste is sweet, folowed by a {unfourtently}  skunky finish. All in all a very nice beer from labat, very tasty and feels good in the blood.

I let it warm a bit before opening.  The pour was not entirely satisfying--no cascade effect, alas--but the head clung admirably for a long time, like the residue of a vanilla ice cream float.  96% opaque black with dark caramel edges.  The aroma indeed reveals hops among the roasted coffee beans and mild smokiness.  Early on in my bottle, the rich coffee flavors seemed to dominate, although from the start there was a distinctive metallic twang snapping against my tongue.  Some nuttiness came out in the aroma about halfway through, and there were some subtle things going on there that raised the standing of this beer.  Yet, the flavor lacked a certain depth, only exacerbated by a mouthfeel that bordered on cola-like carbonation with quick burn-off finish and a limp feeling.  Not a bad beer in a pinch, but the kind of stout better suited as a cooking ingredient than for sipping and savoring. \nEarlier Rating: 8/3/2003 Total Score: 3.3\nInteresting.
