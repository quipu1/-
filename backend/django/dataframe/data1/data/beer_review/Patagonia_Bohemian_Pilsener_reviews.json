Not too much to say as there are many beers that are very similar, but let\u2019s try. A crisp, fresh aroma with noble hop qualities, provided by the Saaz hops. The flavour profile is fresh, with clean pale malts and floral qualities, yet it is missing the herbs and spice from the Saaz hops which are far more evident in Stella Artois; which, if you were wondering, is well known for using the very same hops. There is a mild bitterness to the grainy finish, making it a much more refreshing drink in comparison to Stella which is twice the IBU. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, with a medium body and a medium-high carbonation. The head retention was once again faultless with excellent lacing, but let\u2019s continue to emphasise that these beers are fresh from the brewery, anything less would be a massive worry.\n\nRead the full review here:\n\nwww.beerwithus1.wordpress.com/2019/06/08/patagonia-brewery", "writed_at": "June 9, 2019"}, {"user_id": "Jow", "beer_kor_name": "\ud30c\ud0c0\uace0\ub2c8\uc544 \ubcf4\ud5e4\ubbf8\uc548 \ud544\uc2a4\ub108", "beer_eng_name": "Patagonia Bohemian Pilsener", "review_score": 2.8, "review_content": "Drank 4 for game 5 Stanley Cup.
