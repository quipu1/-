Hardly a drape is left after some time. Not the most special looking beer, but it is nice.\r\nThe smell of the beer quite nice. There aren't a lot of malt aroma's. Maybe just a sweet note. There are quite some nice hop aromas though. They are very fruity. I smell some orange, zest, more citrus fruits and some nice hints of fresh apple. The hops have a nice sour fresh fruity nose. I like it.\r\nThe taste has more malts. There is a nice full malty flavour, giving a soft sweetness. Hops are also present, but are slightly less fruity and zesty, but have more of a piney touch. Still nice though. It is well balanced. Not the most special beer, but it is a nice easy drinkable one.\r\nThe palate of the beer is fine. Light body, thin texture and medium carbonation.

Aroma does indeed remind me of a typical English bitter, with notes of fresh - even burnt - toast, moist white pepper, jute, roasted pine nuts, caramel, dried bitter garden weeds, orange peel, parsley (iron), old cookies, vague hints of cigarette tobacco (unsmoked), hard butterscotch candy, dried grass and some cooked green beans, likely representing pasteurization, which is indeed faintly noticeable and becomes a bit more pronounced as it warms up. Restrained but crisp and clean fruitiness in the onset, hints of dried banana, apricot and unripe plum, sourish and sweetish but both subdued, spritzy and minerally carbonation, smooth and slick, medium body. Malty middle as expected, some faint caramelly sweetness but mostly a nutty and eventually toasted, softly bittering character, matching with gentle and \u2019noble\u2019 hop bitterness in the finish, a tad resinous and tonic water-like and in that sense adequately drying and bittering, floral and grassy, going down alongside the toasted malt bitterness but remaining inside the throat for a longer time than the latter. The term \u2019pale ale\u2019 as such (or in fact EPA - English pale ale) has largely become obsolete these days, but this one qualifies, with a notably nutty and deeply European hop bitter character; originally pale ale was not much more than a bottled bitter anyway. The distinction is vague and a bit shrouded in history, but since the English themselves hardly ever use the term anymore and refer to bottled bitters just as \u2019bitter\u2019 in some or other form, this easily qualifies as one. Hadn\u2019t I known better, I\u2019d situate this in England rather than in the U.S.; clean, crisp, to the point and quenching, this is a fine, albeit somewhat understated and notably \u2019clean\u2019 example of its style.", "writed_at": "November 5, 2016"}, {"user_id": "drjoeng", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ud63c\ucee4\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc77c", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Honkers Ale", "review_score": 3.8, "review_content": "4.3%ABV.

Despite the name, beers of the style tend to be rather sweet and only mildly bitter. Any American brewery that makes one that\u2019s decent is worthy of commendation; such is the case with Goose Island Honkers Ale. This is one of their original brews and I can see why it\u2019s maintained appeal all these years. It\u2019s a very drinker-friendly beer in all aspects (but not an amazing one).\r\n\n\n\r\nI poured a 12oz bottle into a tumbler glass. It was bottled on 7/27/15 and cost $1.66 ($0.14 per ounce).\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: A pretty shade of copper/magenta with a clear body and carbonation visible. Pours to an average-sized, off-white, foamy head which retains and laces well.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Lightly fruity, though I detect some signs of oxidation. Slightly floral; though mild overall.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: There seems to be a lot going on in this beer\u2026 and yet, not much at all. I do taste a genuine malt flavor \u2013 quite grainy and slightly biscuity. This creates for sweetness, but it\u2019s mild. Lurking in the background is a dry bitterness with just a hint of resin. Faint caramel or treacle flavor on the backend which creates for additional sweetness, and then it finishes almost completely clean. All these characteristics are enjoyable to be sure. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t penalize it for being mild since that\u2019s the point of the style. Still, a little more pizzazz would be nice.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: At 4.3% ABV, Goose Island Honkers Ale is a sessionable beer to be sure. The mouthfeel is crisp with a consistent moistness to it as well. Though there is noticeable hop presence, there\u2019s no lingering bitterness. I would consider it refreshing while in the mouth. I could see this working well in the summer, especially from a can, though it\u2019s got the palette to work as a year-round brew, too.\r\n\n\n\r\nRATING: 6/10", "writed_at": "November 13, 2015"}, {"user_id": "Rhombic", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ud63c\ucee4\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc77c", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Honkers Ale", "review_score": 3.1, "review_content": "Bottle, 355mL.

The head fades fast to leave a persistent foam on the top of the brew with very light lacing on the sides of the glass.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013The aroma is very light overall and only consists of a very small amount of roasted malt and caramel.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins with a good caramel malt backbone that creates a rather sweeter and breadier flavor. This taste lasts throughout the taste with very little change. Toward the middle of the taste a notes of toffee and a more buttery flavor comes to the tongue. These mix with a very light herbal and grassy hop flavor at the end of the taste which end up leaving a smooth and sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer for an only 4.3 % abv beer is much creamier then would be anticipated while the carbonation level is rather average. The thicker body is nice for accentuating the toffee and buttery flavors of the brew while the average carbonation level keeps it refreshing and easy drinking.

My first quaff is sweet and dry at the same time, if such a thing is possible. Caramel and toast stand their ground while a solid undercurrent of hops blossom into grass and grapefruit esters. Red grapes and red plums sport their crisp bitter skins before releasing their succulent juicy meats inside. Delicious.
