Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit too lemon/pear fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery finish. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful for the ABV.

They don\u2019t come cheap, but they also don\u2019t come skunked, so I imagine that while I feel 2pac\u2019s pain at the cash register I still trust that the product I\u2019m sampling will be one of finer quality given it\u2019s storage receptacle. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe beer pours a pale golden color with a well retained medium white head. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe aroma is corny with some light green apple &amp; some light herbal character. It doesn\u2019t sound like much but it doesn\u2019t smell particularly offensive. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe flavor is crisp and clean but also corny, but not in a sweet corn kind of way, more in a white tortilla chip kind of way.

Moving on, my first quaff is spritzy, bland, and watery. A couple more quaffs in and some faint sweet lemon and sweet corn makes a pathetically weak play for the flavor scene. The wisp of lime in the back of his nose is present in the finish, though just as dismally faint as everything else in his portfolio. Keeping the lime esters in mind, it then makes sense why lime wedges work so well with this thin cerveza \u201cimport\u201d. A hard bitter lemon skin finish lingers on the top of my tongue far longer than I would like.

Overall, this beer accomplishes its objectives and hits the targets it aims for. An additional bit of information about Corona is related to the clear bottle: it has been explained to me that beer in clear bottles spoils faster than in tinted brown or green bottles because of exposure to light, and there does seem to be a cetain \"skunkiness\" that does seem to develop some of the time when it is purchased in a six pack as opposed to the twelve &amp;#40presumably because the twelve pack bottles are fully enclosed in a box&amp;#41.

I have a couple of theories about Corona.  One is that the beer\u2019s cool decal label and clear bottle are the main factors in its popularity.  It is a great label, one of the best ever - simple, simultaneously old and new, classy.  I could look at a bottle of Corona for a while.  My other theory is that the added wedge of lime (often stuck in the bottleneck) is the main thing that makes it good.  Without that wedge of lime, we\u2019re talking about a very ordinary beer, no better than Bud, for example.  But something about the Corona recipe interacts very well with lime and turns it into a pretty good beer.  Very pale pour with a little head.  Aroma is pleasantly sweet and fragrant, a nice surprise!  Without lime it tastes like a mediocre sugary pilsner with a light touch of tingly hops.   Now we put in a generous squirt of lime.  This does not improve the aroma, unfortunately - but it does transform the flavor into the \"la cerveza mas fina\" that everyone knows about.  Now the taste becomes complex and likeable, but still light.  The citrus notes bounce off the gently bitter hops, while the summery sweetness plays in the background.  There are lime and hops in the finish, and you can vary the tune by how much juice you put in.  Not bad.  So my rating will be an average of the two (with lime and without).  The high appearance rating is a salute to the label.

The nose on this beer is horrible. Corona is marketed in clear glass bottles, and with clear glass, or green glass, beer can become what is known as light struck. I won\u2019t get into the science of it, but the bottom line is, light, and heat are deadly enemies of beer. It makes a beer smell and taste skunky. The nose on the bottle of Corona I drank was very skunky, no malt or hop aromas were present. The palate? More of the same, a slight skunky flavor, mixed with lots of fizzy carbonation on the tongue, and a very thin, and watery body. This beer finished with more skunky flavor that ended with a black hole of nothing. In a word, this beer was disgusting. \r\n\r\nThat is the true flavor of Corona folks. As a beer, it is a mass produced, bland lager with little flavor and character. How does Corona get over on us, and why is it so popular? People drink it ICE cold, and with a healthy dose of lime to mask the flavors. Or on the odd chance you might get a bottle that is not light struck, lime add some flavor, to a beer that has virtually none. Try a Corona thats true flavor isn\u2019t numbed with cold, or spiked with lime, and you will understand what a poor beer Corona really is. What really boggles my mind, is, people are willing to pay MORE for this beer. You might as well save yourself a few bucks and squeeze a lime into a Miller Lite, or even a Milwaukee\u2019s Best, those beers have as much flavor and character as Corona. Corona drinkers are being duped, and ripped off in my opinion. What are you really paying for? A painted bottle? The quality is just not there, it is just great marketing of a poor beer. \r\n\r\nI will leave you with this. I attended a beer dinner with Micheal Jackson, The Beer Hunter. He is the most recognized authority on beer in the world. As chance would have it, Jackson and I was in the men\u2019s room, doing what men do after they drink lots of beer at a beer dinner.
