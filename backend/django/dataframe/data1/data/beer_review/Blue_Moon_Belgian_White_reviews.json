The only good brand was Staropramen I've tasted recently. So i was very skeptic about this Blue Moon, i told to the beer shop girl not to order it, cz it's fake. And yes, i had right. This is a fake, plastic version of Belgian Witbier. It wants to be a Belgian Witbier but it can't, cz u can feel it it's just fake. Not bad anyway, but the head is weak, the aromas are weak too, the taste is overpowered by peach and nectarine, it wants to be a style too much that it's not.

They had a best before date of 5/19/14 and came as part of a 12-pack for $14.47 ($1.20 per bottle or $0.10 per ounce).\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Hazy orange hue (too dark for the style). Translucent with some fine carbonation visible. Pours to a small, white, soapy head which nearly completely dissipates and leaves no lacing.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Sweet orange scent, but reminiscent of artificial flavoring. Not much authentic Belgian character to it. \r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: Blue Moon is usually scoffed at by craft beer enthusiasts, and for good reason. But a lot of us forget that the beer serves a purpose of being a stepping stone from fizzy yellow beer to good beer. And in that capacity, this beer is great. As an actual Belgian White it\u2019s far from a good example of the style. While there\u2019s nothing particularly wrong with the palette here, there\u2019s nothing especially good about it, either. The flavors seem a little inauthentic and what\u2019s there is too simple and mild.\r\n\n\n\r\nUpon my first swig I was immediately reminded of a pumpkin beer. The orangepeel and coriander spices are noticeable right away. They create for a zingy sensation, though they seem to fade away rather quickly. Through the middle there\u2019s a sweet, almost sugary taste of orange flavoring akin to orange-flavored soda (not rich like orange juice concentrate). It finishes with a surprisingly dull, grainy taste not unlike that of a macro lager, which is actually quite baffling. Personally, I\u2019m not offended by this palette, but it has a long way to go to truly impress me.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: Say what you want about the taste, but it\u2019s hard to dispute the fact Blue Moon is highly drinkable. Even drinking it indoors on a cold winter\u2019s night it\u2019s remarkably refreshing. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side and noticeable crisp, but not fizzy. It leaves just a slight pasty aftertaste, though it\u2019s easily tolerable. It doesn\u2019t seem to take full advantage of its 5.4% ABV weight.

I can\u2019t really name any other spices here simply cause I don\u2019t know what exactly most spices taste like. No sign of clove, which I think is a must in a witbier. Not really any hop character, but that\u2019s not really a surprise from a mass marketed beer.\r\n\r\n3.5 M: Medium body. Good carbonation. I\u2019d score it higher, but something is amiss and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t identify what it is.\r\n\r\n4.5 D: It\u2019s the kind of drink that you can handle all night. It\u2019s not the greatest, but definitely an all-nighter kind of beer.\r\n\r\nClose to the best I\u2019d expect from a macro brewery, so well done. This was a gift from my uncle. If I can help it, I won\u2019t be buying this in the future as Coors has enough money.\r\n\r\nServing type: bottle\r\n\r\nReviewed on: 12-04-2008 05:22:04", "writed_at": "January 11, 2011"}, {"user_id": "Shrews629", "beer_kor_name": "\ube14\ub8e8\ubb38", "beer_eng_name": "Blue Moon Belgian White", "review_score": 3.0, "review_content": "Cloudy orange and yellow color.

Have you ever had glass of beer from the bottom of the keg? Well personally I think this is the best beer in the keg. I must have got one of the last glasses in the keg because it was fabulous! I was floored. I could not believe it! So today I tried a 22oz. bottle hoping for the best. To say the least I was very disappointed. Imagine taking a good unfiltered wheat beer and diluting it with three bottles of water and then doubling the carbonation. Was it horrible? No. Was is good? No. Will I buy it again? Maybe on tap once more.

Ah where to begin my adventure of the Blue Moon Belgian White Ale, how about the begining. Well it was a warm Friday night in July and I was at a minor league ball game and thought to myself, \"hey Dave how bout a beer\". I replied to myself, \"sure sounds good now lets go see what they have\". So I saunter over to the rat trap bar in center field which unabashedly proclaims their allegance to Coors by having enough neon and plastic signage covering every third inch of the building so that the batter at home plate has something to aim for. Well I look at my choices, Coors LIght, Coors Extra Gold, another tap handle of Coors Light and wait what\u2019s this a Belgian White Ale the tap handle proclaims, why yes indeed that will do. So I pluck down my hard earned $5.25 in US currency while Sid, well he looked like a Sid anyway, fills up my lovely 14 oz plastic shaker. I moisten my lips as I am filled with anticipation of the joyous aromas and bountiful flavors which are sure to be found inside my plastic grail of golden nectar. After the hazy orange liquid begins to overflow the glass, which is obviously the way to pour beer since every barkeep at this fine institution pours this way, Sid eventually decides that the glass can hold no more and shuts the tap off. But wait he\u2019s not done yet, oh no not yet. Next comes the magic of the Blue Moon Belgian White Ale because inside every glass is a lovely slice of dried up warm orange. Yes I rejoice as the slice of dead rotting fruit is plopped on top of the quarter inch of foamy head that was allowed to remain. Finally the finsihed product is handed to me and my hand trembles as I pick up my long awaited treat. My heart skips a beat and my lip quivers with anticipation as I raise the mighty plastic cup to my undeserving mouth. I close my eyes inhale deeply and finally take a sip.

Belgian White, looks and tastes like a goodwill effort on the behalf of brewing magnates to pry Americans from their dear and all too near cans of pale lager and into something a bit more sophisticated.  While it may not always be successful in stomping out a passionate community of withered lager drinkers, the Blue Moon takes steps to wean them off their sickly addiction and into something with more depth.  When I was a wee lad I was introduced to good beer by means of a Witbier: Hoegaarden.  Sadly, Hoegaarden is just a bit too foreign and a tad too hard to spell for the average Yankee to pick up and enjoy.  So to me Blue Moon is a good prologue to what will hopefully be many long and elaborate chapters of the book of elegant beers.  I was well into my beerological career by the time I had Blue Moon, but ordered a glass on the hypothetical premise that I had missed something potentially crucial to my education.  A scholar of literature has an equal obligation to read Jane Austen as he does to read J.K. Rowling for the same reason that both have an impact on the reading community, even though they are of disparate depths.  So the same applies here, though I can\u2019t make any vainglorious claims to a superior understanding of beer.  As for the Blue Moon itself, the color is a very cloudy apricot orange, topped with a thin and ethereal head.  The smell is linear; a pinch of citrus and the rest is fairly yeasty.  The taste is extremely difficult for me to pick apart; I want to say it reminds me of weak salsa or corn meal, but those make it sound less appealing than it is.  The flavor may be elusive, but it isn\u2019t complex.  It is sufficient to say that it\u2019s miles above Coors\u2019 popular swill, and should be used as a guiding hand when helping a victim of bad beer to find the shining path to a delicious beer future.", "writed_at": "September 17, 2007"}, {"user_id": "stoutchap", "beer_kor_name": "\ube14\ub8e8\ubb38", "beer_eng_name": "Blue Moon Belgian White", "review_score": 2.0, "review_content": "Was that a beer I just drank?
