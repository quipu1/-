Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Bit of skunky aromas initially, but dissipated as it sat in the glass. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very good German pilsener. All around nice robustness and balance of robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the moderately bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and never watery for the ABV. Nicely rich and clean pils malt flavors, with nice earthy hop presence/balance. A very enjoyable offering and spot on style example.

I\u2019m not really sure what is more interesting; this beer, or the articles online that surround it. I\u2019ve read about the possibility of AB halting the brand, all the way to them paying people back their money (and then some) for drinking it. All because people can\u2019t fathom the idea of an imported beer being brewed in their backyard. Or in this way, the great gateway to the west. I\u2019m not one to care. When it comes to this kind of beer, I tend to remain on the less picky side. Although a US brewed Becks VS a German brewed Becks would be a fun blind taste test. All of this added up to the thought crossing my mind that I better rate this before I lose my opportunity. That, coupled with the fact that growing up, this was my Dad\u2019s favorite beer, and drank it about as much as I drink every other beer combined. I suppose I also hadn\u2019t submitted a long, random, rambling review in a while, so I guess I\u2019m killing a half dozen birds with one beer. I felt very silly pouring this into a glass, but I did for color and appearance reviews alone. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll drink the rest properly out of the bottle. When it comes to green bottle, premium import/export (see above) lagers, this one is decently refreshing and most importantly, finishable. Nearly transparent pale yellow color with an aroma that filled the room upon cracking it open. Extremely light flavor. About as watery as they come. There isn\u2019t a single flavor strong enough to identify or point out. I certainly wouldn\u2019t use the word \"complex\" in it\u2019s description, but no heavy complaints here.

Nothing in the way of adjuncts, but nothing appealing to the aroma.

I\u2019d like to think the authentic German version, though it is a macro lager, would be a little bit better than \"just barely tolerable.\" While I\u2019ve had several fizzy yellow beers that are much worse than Beck\u2019s, I have to say I\u2019m genuinely disappointed by how bad this beer is. The flavor is virtually non-existent (which is nice, actually), but it\u2019s the awful finish that ruins it. If it tasted like generic macro lager it would be an improvement. Honestly, there\u2019s just nothing for my taste buds to latch on to. Though, the backside of each swig brings with it an astringent, foul taste of something akin to saltwater or maybe even bile. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s accounting for this, but I definitely don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t see how anyone could.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: Though the beer was plenty bubbly in the glass, the mouthfeel was surprisingly tepid and smooth. I had no trouble drinking down Beck\u2019s in large gulps, but it was at not point refreshing. There\u2019s also a slightly bitter, starchy aftertaste that I could do without. Thankfully, it\u2019s fairly light at 4.8% ABV (according to ratebeer - the can doesn\u2019t indicate).

The beer I tasted came in a 1 pint can, poured into a Lager Glass. Aroma is pretty strong, moderate citrus hops, very very light malt.  Relatively generous size creamy white head when pouring. Color is a light yellow, and not particularly attractive. I must say that it left pretty decent lacing around my glass. Flavor is short in duration, and a bit watered down in taste, but still pleasant. The hops come throught the most, and I would guess that this would go quite well with food. By itself, like I said, it is a bit boring and watery. Texture is watery again and a bit on the dry side of things. Carbonation is soft and the finish is extremely clean, very nice.

He had a long lost uncle named Ludwick Von Beck who died and left good ol Klaus with an old abandoned brewery he had gotten from his grandfather. After months of searching the authorities found Klaus and told him the \"good news\"  Well Klaus was beside himself. Imagine a brewery just for him. So he rounded up several of his friends from the \"Skid Row\" of Bremen and commenced to have a big party on cheap wine, Sour Kraut, And Brauts, with some Occassional Oatmeal for Breakfast. This went on for days and days. When time came for Klaus' friends to relieve themselves, and not knowing the layout of his new inheritance, he just told them to go ahead and \"do it\" in the Big Vat in the brewhouse. Well after several weeks and \"the party was over\" Klaus noticed that the odors in the brewhouse were none too pleasant. He didn't know exactly what to do, and didn't want the authorities to come and fine him or put him in jail; and he didn't know where to dump this liquid emulsion in the vat. He then saw hundreds of empty bottles and decided he'd put this bodily excrement into them. It took a while, but he managed. Being a man with a good sense of humor, Klaus thought to himself... Geez if I cap these bottles off and sell them, I'd have a good joke going, and maybe make a few bucks too. Then I can leave the country with some money in my pocket. And So He Did, and that boys and girls is how Becks Beer was born.....\r\n\r\nThis Crap Tastes Exactly like an NA.
