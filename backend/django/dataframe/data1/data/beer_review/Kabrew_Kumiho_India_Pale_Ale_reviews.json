Slick palate.\n\nMouth Feel: Good Amber Ale maltyness in a solid but carbo-ish background, pretty bock-ish and Munich-like with notable caramel and red fruits. Strong grapefruit and lemony hops dominate with good herbal character. Flowery with right amount of strong sweetness. Piney, slightly oozy and biscuity with strong grass to round. Solid!\n\nHoppiness: Strong oranges, pineapples, honey, grapefruits, citrus, yellow fruits, floral, spices, lemon and grass in nose. Strong grapefruits, floral, spices, strong herbs, pine, resins, strong lemon and strong grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, closer-to-high level bitter Amber malty finish.\n\nAfter Taste: Fairly dry. Piney herbal grapefruit and bitter to mouth.\t\n\nComments: After having two sub-par Kumiho beers (the Peach Ale and Relax Beer), this one finally means business: good solid Amber Ale body, nice tropical fruiy hops aroma with strong grapefruit and herbal piney taste, round with strong lemon and grass. A cross between American and traditional English IPA, this is decent and worth every penny!", "writed_at": "April 13, 2021"}]
