I find that other German lagers from larger brewers tend to become almost muddled, and resemble the macro lagers that they are a little too much (a shame). Paulaner still has a distinct aroma, flavour, and palate that I believes serves as evidence of their quality ingredients. There is no mistaking the typical bready/yeasty aroma of the beer, and the flavour is the refreshing blend of fresh bread, grass, and subdued but present hops that one looks for in this kind of beer.

Milled grain, slight sweetness and a hint of orangepeel or other citrus pith.\n\nTaste: Pale lagers and pilsners are among my least favorite styles of beer, so if one can make me say anything more than \"meh\" you know it\u2019s doing something right. That\u2019s definitely the case of Paulaner Lager - I honestly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like it this much, but it\u2019s pretty good. Up front is a light malty sweetness with a cold, refreshing quality. It\u2019s a clean taste without the oily qualities you tend to get in American adjunct macro lagers. For a moment in the middle there is a quick hop nibble. Just a minute amount of bitterness that you find in pale lagers of the sort. The end finishes much like it begins with a mild sweetness with a hint of orange fruit and orange peel flavor. It\u2019s not necessarily tart or acid like you\u2019d get with a hop forward beer like an IPA, but just much more character than your average pale lager. \n\nMouthfeel: Perfectly medium-bodied, actually. Not overly fizzy or carbonated. Refreshing while in the mouth, but it does leave a dry, pasty aftertaste.\n\nDrinkability: I drank Paulaner Lager outside on a hot day and it was surprisingly refreshing. The clean, cold, mild palate really make it a beer to drink for the sake of drinking a beer. While the aftertaste is a little annoying, it\u2019s easily obscured by taking another swig. It weighs in at only 4.9% ABV and satisfies as if it were something heavier. \n\nOverall, Paulaner Original Munich Lager is one of the best German lagers I\u2019ve ever had.", "writed_at": "September 9, 2011"}, {"user_id": "Erasmus_ro", "beer_kor_name": "\ud30c\uc6b8\ub77c\ub108 \uc624\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub110 \ubb8c\ud5e8", "beer_eng_name": "Paulaner Original M\u00fcnchner Hell (Premium Lager)", "review_score": 2.7, "review_content": "Draught.

Thankfully, there are some who refuse to compromise their principles, standards, tradition, and taste by continuing to brew a tasty lager of quality ingredients and brewing. Paulaner has a long history in Germany, tracing back to the original Paulist himself, Francis of Paola, who started the monastery and brewery. Beer was liquid bread and thus free from the chopping block of fasting, along with being a product they could eventually sell for self-sustaining income.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nShe pours golden hay with a soft white head resembling cotton fields, their blooms threatening to blow loose in the passing breeze. She sports a lovely white collar, pressed and primped for all to see, while her perfume of honeycomb, soft white bread, white crackers, and green grass are supported by fields of grain basking in the warm summer sun. My first quaff is fresh hay and straw, a brilliant reminder of the cereals and grains of yore that I used to munch on for a fun, tasty snack in-between long bouts playing outside. Her sweet side is a gentle touch of honey with the earthy honeycomb balancing wonderfully with her grainy underbelly. Soft, dry water crackers linger with a delicate dryness of mouth which is easily quenched by another quaff of this fine German lager. I am surprised by her overall soft mouthfeel which shows a snappier side only every now and then with green grass and lemon skins. Clean, tasteful, and easy to session, the Paulaner Lager is an excellent German lager and a fine example of brewing heritage which laughs in the face of conformist mediocrity.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery now and then I will stumble across a lager which puts a contended smile on my face; the Paulaner Lager was just one of those.
