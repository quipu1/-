The head is surprisingly large and with great retention. The aroma is strongly herbal at the edges, with a body of orange bread and pale ales. Smells more herbal than fruity. The taste is very soft, gentle wheat first, barley second, with very noticeable coriander. It has a delicate balance, I wouldn't call it sweet nor dry. Light, and definitely very herbal. A little watery, very bready. As it goes through the mouth, there is a proeminent orange bread flavour, but absolutely none of the usual citric bitterness or sourness. The orange taste is, however, not overpowering. It is very well blended among the main flavours of grains and coriander. The aftertaste is strongly herbal, heavy coriander, with a background of hops and orange, only a tiny bit of sourness, and very watery. Almost as if you had drank a delicious cold tea.", "writed_at": "January 26, 2020"}, {"user_id": "tfontana", "beer_kor_name": "\ud638\uac00\ub4e0", "beer_eng_name": "Hoegaarden", "review_score": 3.6, "review_content": "Bottle pour from BevMax, Hamden.

Geur heel lichte citroen geurtje maar vooral prettig geur van hop. Troebel lichtgeel wit bier precies hoe in mijn beleving witbier er uit moet zien. Schuimt mooi verdwijnt ook niet meteen. Licht zurig met een bittertje maar niet te zoet en smaakt gelukkig niet kunstmatig naar citroenen. Wat je beide tegenwoordig helaas vaak bij frisse zomer biertjes ziet en gewoon averechts werkt. Zou koriander en zelfs sinaasappelschil in zitten. Maar dan zeg ik zeer subtiel en versterkt dan alleen zijn perfecte smaak. Maar als je weet waar je om moet letten proef je zowaar een hint ervan.

Time for an objective analysis, poured from a 25 cl can. Shows the typical moussy, dense and stable, creamy, off-white head leaving good lacing; colour is a pale lemony yellow blonde with a somewhat greenish hue, equally cloudy from the start. Aroma immediately recognizable as the thirst-quencher I had dozens of times from tap and from bottles: soap, coriander seed, raw white cabbage, sourish wheat, white bread, lime zest, fresh orange peel, white candi sugar, starch, \u2019industrial\u2019 apple cake, vanilla pudding, allspice, moscadet wine, sweetened yoghurt but very clear iron as well; strangely for an AB InBev beer, I can detect no sign of pasteurization, so I assume it is a \u2019living\u2019 beer. Taste starts with a sweetish, applish fruitiness, hint of apricot, minerally carbo, the sourishness of which is further enhanced by the wheat and a dried lemon peel effect, mellow and gentle, smooth mouthfeel, starch again as in potato mash, something sugary lingering on, thinnish and a bit metallic, finishing in a bready malt sweetness and lightly sourish \u2019wheatiness\u2019, drying coriander and low but noticeable grassy hoppiness, leafy and lingering at the back of the tongue longer than expected. Anyone who knows me is familiar with my aversion against AB InBev, but I have to admit this is one of their better products; once again I would wish for a time machine to taste this back in the seventies, but in its current form, it is still very acceptable as the archetype of the witbier style. When InBev intended to move production of this from their Hoegaarden plant to Jupille for economical reasons, a storm of protest arose in Belgium, aptly illustrating the Belgians\u2019 loyalty to their national brands; I was given the opportunity to taste two experimental preproduction brews of it made in Jupille and liked the spicier version of the two better, but eventually InBev had to give in and bring this iconic beer back to Hoegaarden. I have the impression they are \u2019afraid\u2019 to tinker with it any further: this is a beacon of Belgian brewing art, something one does not compromize. A side-by-side tasting of this grandfather of witbiers and its many clones would prove interesting, I think. But no matter how loyal this is to its style: it still has a slight metallic, common, impersonal, industrial feel to it and to my taste, it is too sweet for the style. Still: AB InBev seems to keep a remarkably good quality standard towards this, so let\u2019s argue it still remains the ultimate witbier, setting a standard of its own. I hate to admit it, but there is not much wrong with this - if seen in its context of style, of course. But let\u2019s not compare with the dozens of artisanal, \u2019deviating\u2019 takes on the style (especially Wallonian), though: that would be an unfair comparison...", "writed_at": "December 29, 2015"}, {"user_id": "Gylo", "beer_kor_name": "\ud638\uac00\ub4e0", "beer_eng_name": "Hoegaarden", "review_score": 3.3, "review_content": "Typowy Witbier, nieco chyba zbyt mocno nagazowany.

In all, it\u2019s a \"B\" grade beer - good, but not extraordinary. Appearance: gray-yellow, large amount of white foam on top.  Aroma: faint overall with citrus and floral notes. Taste: Yeast, bread, and citrus. Low level of hops and bitterness, as is typical of wits following a tradition of shunning much use of hops.  Mouthfeel: light and smooth, with a balanced amount of carbonation. Witbiers often have higher-than-average carbonation levels in order to balance out the malt-sweetness. Overall: It\u2019s a solid Belgian White/Witbier and probably a good baseline marking the threshold of what\u2019s above and below average for the style.  There\u2019s nothing adventurous here, but it\u2019s still enjoyable and great for the summertime.  Plus, it\u2019s readily available and usually pretty cheap at about $1.25/bottle.  Trivia (adding to the recognition of certain ingredients and taste aspects): Witbiers stem from the beers of the middle ages in the Netherlands, and instead of using hops for preservation and flavor, they used a blend of spices called \"gruit.\"  The orange peels and coriander spices used in Hoegaarden are a remnant of that gruit tradition, although nowadays most witbiers also incorporate some hops into the mix. Witbier, which is Dutch for \"white beer\"  is in the same family as weissbier, which is German for \"white beer.\"  Witbier and  weissbiers are white because they\u2019re unfiltered and have a hazy appearance due to the type of yeast they contain.  Whites also make use of unmalted wheat, as opposed to malted wheat.  In northern Germany, a similar beer would be termed a hefe-weizen, \"yeast-wheat.\"  In France, it\u2019s \"la bier-blanche.\"", "writed_at": "July 13, 2012"}, {"user_id": "ALavery03", "beer_kor_name": "\ud638\uac00\ub4e0", "beer_eng_name": "Hoegaarden", "review_score": 4.1, "review_content": "Poured from bottle into a Guinness pint glass.

Of course, my frame of reference was American takes on the style, what would an authentic Belgian White be like? Hoegaarden was the beer I turned to in order to solve that mystery and I\u2019m glad I did, because its authenticity was apparent from the moment I popped the cap to the last swig.\n\nPOUR, COLOR AND AROMA\n\nHoegaarden is one of a handful of beers for which there is a type of glass specifically made for it. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t own that glass so I had to improvise. Poured from a bottle, the beer forms a fairly large layer of bright white foamy head which never dissipates and leaves generous lacing on the glass. Not surprisingly, the body is very cloudy with a white color to the exterior and a pale yellow hue at the center. Clove is immediately evident in the nose, as are other spices and yet the beer has a sweet aroma.\n\nTASTE\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect out of Hoegaarden. From its outer appearance, it seemed to be very similar to an authentic hefeweizen rather than the American-style \u201cBelgian Whites\u201d I\u2019ve been used to. And after my first sip I knew this beer resembled the former rather than the latter.\n\nMy first impression of the taste is that of a watery body with a light amount of spices to the palate. Clove, orange peel and coriander immediately stand out giving the beer a slightly citrusy taste, and yet it is not tart or sour at all. The overall flavor is quite sweet, but the intensity seems to be dialed-down a bit. I was expecting an explosion of taste, but the blow seemed to be cushioned by a watery composition. \n\nStill, there was definite taste to be had, rather than just \u201cbeer,\u201d and the spices give the beer a bit of a bite.\n\nFINISH\n\nMuch like stouts, I\u2019ve yet to encounter a wheat beer that is anything less than smooth. Hoegaaden is absolutely no challenge for a serious beer drinker, and Joe and Jane Six Pack will find it reminiscent of a light lager due to its watery complexion and calm palate.\n\nBODY\n\nConsidering how easy this beer is to drink, as well as it\u2019s genuine (but not over-powering) taste, combined with a body that is only 4.9% ABV, Hoegaarden would make an excellent session beer. I drank two bottles back-to-back without feeling overwhelmed in the least, and I doubt many other drinkers would be either.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThe only thing that bummed me out about Hoegaarden was that its taste wasn\u2019t as strong as I would prefer. My experiences with American takes on the style are absolutely delicious, but this was more of a true crafty brew, rather than anything gimmicky. At $10 a six-pack it\u2019s a bit pricey, but definitely worth trying. \n\nNOTE: watch the video version of this review at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGu8IOe3liQ", "writed_at": "March 2, 2010"}, {"user_id": "tennessejed420", "beer_kor_name": "\ud638\uac00\ub4e0", "beer_eng_name": "Hoegaarden", "review_score": 3.6, "review_content": "12 oz. bottle.

Obviously in hurry at all, she took her time fading into a splotchy layer of white puffs floating on top of the brew below while leaving trails of brussels lace behind. Pepper, coriander, clove, and spice in the nose hints of a delectable experience. A quaff, then a second, and I are in Hoegaarden bliss. Their recipe a closely guarded secret, I can see why since no one has yet mastered the spicy wit beer as they have. A light and soft body while at the same time being full of chewy wheat. Her body leaves a soft coating on my tongue and mouth as the pepper, coriander, and spices linger. Creamy bananas add even more softness and a lingering creamy presence to the spiced brew. While it all sounds like a mish-mash conglomeration of flavors, mouthfeel, and palate, Hoegaarden comes together in a perfect harmony of spices which are carried on a gentle body of wheat and smoothed over with a light creamy banana presence. A culminate excellence.\r\n\n\r\nHoegaarden is as good as and even better them I remember her years ago. Some may argue that her recipe over the years has been tweaked and toned down since its purchase by InBev, a macro giant.

Just a hint of sweetness lurks behind the mild bitterness of the spice and orange peel.  The only improvement I\u2019d like to see is a stronger finish: the finish isn\u2019t watery, but most of the flavors trail off considerably, leaving just a mild bitterness to linger on the palate.  Light in body, medium carbonation, wonderfully clean and refreshing.  The nose is mostly spices along with background wheat, though there\u2019s a hint of banana esters from the yeast.

Flavor is much of the same but with a more spicey character; vanilla and orange make up the sweet and sour notes with pepper and light herbal notes backing throughout.  Grainy wheat notes and light yeast is also apparent with a low bitterness.  Palate is a bit weak, medium-light, lively, and a watery-creamy feel.

It needs just enough force to perform, but enough silence to impress.  Hoegaarden, like its personified equivalent the gymnast, accomplishes that task.  It is a graceful beer with a graceful touch, and like an accomplished spy it makes its presence known and leaves before anybody can question its intent.  So, for a simple beer, the Hoegaarden is difficult to touch.  The visual appearance is a straightforward cloudy yellow.  The shade reminds me of faded 1970\u2019s lawn furniture, but don\u2019t let that discourage you from drinking it.  The foam is thin and white and, sadly, unengaging, but I don\u2019t expect a heavy blanket on top of something like a witbier.  The aroma gave me shivers at first, but that may be because my earlier experience with this type of beer was extremely disappointing.  Inside the smell is the obvious wheat, a complement of lemon and a slightly distracting modicum of soap.  If I really stretch it I can smell sour dough bread, but I think that may be my fondness for San Francisco and clam chowder speaking.  Most surprising to me is the duration of Hoegaarden\u2019s taste.  Like I mentioned before, it slips in and out before I can really grasp it and pick it apart.  What I do know about this sly beer, is it\u2019s an excellent drink after some exercise or a hard day of pushing papers or furniture or whatever it is you do.  Also, best served at colder temperatures.  Unlike Belgian Ales the taste does not improve with warmth.  Overall I\u2019d describe this beer as being very mild mannered and ethereal.

I personally think there is too much coriander taste to it.  It\u2019s what hits you first and then as it passes along your tongue you finally get the citrus taste that Blue Moon gives you right away.

If you ask for a WHO-GAR-DEN and they correct you with HOH-GAARDEN, tell them that you were right in the first place, and belgiuns are actualy offended by the false name. IF YOU HAVE THIS AT HOME. first, ignore the bottle instructions. Take a chilled bottle, and SLOWLY rotate it upside down. Hold it for 20 seconds, roll it back strait, another 20 seconds. Repeet. Rince a 12 oz glass, If you\u2019ve got a Hoegarden Glass, use it, if not  a strait Pillsner glass is better than a goblet.  Rince the glass with cold water, shake it so there are small sparce drops of water all through-out. open beer. Wait 5 seconds. pour 3/4 of the beer at a 45 degree angle. Let beer rest 50-60 seconds while you SWIRL the remaining beer to dissolve all leftover lees. with the glass on the table, pour the remaning beer strait in the center of the head. Try to get every drop of foam from the bottle. Wait another 10 seconds. Use a knife or you\u2019re finger to \"cut\" from one side of the glass head to the other, smothing the head flat with the glass and removing all head above the rim. 1/8 a lemon on the rim. And you\u2019re done. Exelent beer for a lady, plus if you go through all trouble to pour you\u2019re lady a beer, it shows care.
