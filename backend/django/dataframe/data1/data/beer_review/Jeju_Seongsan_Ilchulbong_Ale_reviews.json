Crisp and slick palate.\n\nMouth Feel: Solid Ale maltyness in thinned but slick background. Prominent hop-driven taste as in citrus zest, pine needle, herbs and grass. Moderate sweetness and light biscuits. Good lemon to round. Great!   \n\nHoppiness: Strong peaches, mangoes, candied fruits, yellow fruits, honey, light perfume, floral, spices, lemon and grass in nose. Strong citrus zest, floral, fair pine, herbs, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, mid to high level bitter Ale malty finish.\n\nAfter Taste: Dry. Herbal citrus and quite bitter to mouth.\n\nComments: This is a surprisingly good English style Golden Ale starting with nice head and looks, light but right malty body to support the mesmerizing yellow fruity hops aroma and tight herbal citrus taste. Excellent quencher, who would have thought this is from Jeju of all places? Highly recommended!", "writed_at": "March 21, 2021"}]
