Slick palate.\n\nMouth Feel: Light maltyness in very wheaty but slick background. Phenolic and clove-spicy, with good emphasis of orange peels and coriander. Flowery with very little sweetness, bready yeasty with fair lemon to round. Solid!\n\nHoppiness: Light floral, spice, lemon and light grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is low for an abrupt, low-level bitter wheat malty finish.\n\nAfter Taste: Quite dry. Peely spicy and slightly bitter to mouth.\t\n\nComments: This is a hybrid of Belgian White and German Weissbier, as the latter\u2019s banana nose and phenolic / clove characters shines through the equally strong orange peels and coriander. It was also blessed with good looks and head and well-tuned wheatyness for an easy and tasty drinking.
