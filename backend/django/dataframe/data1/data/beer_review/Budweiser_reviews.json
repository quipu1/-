It would be nice to compare Budejovicky Budwar and Budweiser, because the American one gave the name after the Czech region. Anheuser\u2013Busch has been involved in a trademark dispute with European beer companies, in particular the Budweiser Budvar Brewery of \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice from Czech Republic, over the trademark rights to the name \"Budweiser\". Beer has been brewed in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice. The \"American\" name Budweiser is a derivative adjective, meaning \"of Budweis\". In 1876, Adolphus Busch and his friend Carl Conrad, a liquor importer, developed a \"Bohemian-style\" lager in the United States, inspired after a trip to the region. Also we have to add the fact that in the mid 18th century German refugees didn't like American lagers, so they started to produce their own beer. Everything was given except the good quality barley so they started to use rice (around 30%) to cover the lack of barley quality and to make clear wine (USA barley is very high in protein). The second problem was the yeast (it was quick so the lager didn't finish fermentation), so the breweries started to craft it. They produced very neutral wood chips which could help to finish the fermentation with their natural gaps inside. The beer is not a big deal anyway, the history is much more interesting. Semi-pale golden colour, average foam, average CO2, rice can be discovered on the nose, watery palate with a bit of citrus note in the background.

It was canned on 28 December 2013 and cost $1.64 ($0.07 per ounce).\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Pretty shade of white gold, crystal clear with fine carbonation visible.

Only faint hint of malt and some acetaldehyde. \r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: There\u2019s no beer that epitomizes the American adjunct macro lager more than Budweiser. The self-proclaimed \"King of Beers\" is merely the king of sales. Of course, popularity does not necessarily equal quality and this beer is proof of that. Frankly, it seems more bland than repulsive to me, but then again it\u2019s extreme lack of genuine quality is what\u2019s repulsive.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrank cold the palette is virtually neutral tasting. A hint of pale malt character plus some starch character from the rice adjunct. If it warms to anything beyond fridge temp it begins to emit a distinct tanginess. Slightly metallic in nature as well as mealy green apple (a surefire indicator of acetaldehyde). For the most part, it\u2019s ignorable, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact there just isn\u2019t anything in the genuine palette to enjoy. I\u2019m offended by its inoffensiveness.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: If there\u2019s anything a beer like Budweiser ought to be good for, it\u2019s drinkability. And indeed this beer excels in that area. The mouthfeel is thin with a consistent crispness that crackles across the tongue as it goes down. Sometime the carbonation gets stuck in the throat, but it\u2019s always quaffable. It finishes mostly clean with just a slightly starchy aftertaste.

First time I had this beer was last March in Mexico, imported from the United States.

It surprised me here. Enormous activity in the glass, with a continuous stream of countless bubbles feeding the head.\r\nNot much on the aroma front, not bad, but not anything notable either. Just, neutral, except from a faint rice smell.\r\nHmm, \"meh\" taste. I don\u2019t mind the rice taste in a beer, on the contrary sometimes I like it, but this one has it so subtle and flat that goes almost unnoticeable.\r\nVery thin on the body and very light carbonation.\r\nBack in Mexico this beer was a great break from all those corn flavoured mexican beers. Back here though it\u2019s just a below the average beer. I can see why it is so popular in some places though, it\u2019s very drinkable on a hot day and if you just came back home from work on a summer evening, this is a great thirst quencher.

Unlike a lot of bad macro lagers (looking at you, Miller Lite), this isn\u2019t oppressively carbonated, rather it\u2019s just fairly strong.

Teasing his golden depths, faint esters of wonderbread, key lime, ears of corn still green and awaiting harvesting from their green husks finish with a hard mineral bite. Soda water comes to mind. My first quaff is much sweeter than I was expecting with sweet butter rolls and honey-glazed bread. There is no finish at all, just a residual wetness at the back of my throat which reminds me that I just swallowed some sort of liquid. Lemon and lime zip across the top of my tongue while wet bread offers meager weight to his body. Furthering our journey of the damned, a typical dank and slightly rotten finish starts to rear its ugly head. Whether a product of inferior ingredients, the lack of enough ingredients, chemical additives, an unnaturally fast brewing process and far too short lagering time\u2026or all the above, pretty much all inferior macro lagers waste no time developing that rotten dank finish. A couple more quaffs and it\u2019s a wash, rinse, and repeat of the same. The only thing that progresses is the growing unpleasant dank funk and so the reputable giant, Budweiser, joins his rightful place down my kitchen plumbing.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nEver wonder why the large majority of your macro lager drinkers don\u2019t finish their bottle or pint? As they near the end and the arctic chill starts to wear off, their tastebuds awaken to the horrible swill they have been enduring and proceed to scream for relief. Unfortunately, the relief usually comes in the form of another freezing cold bottle or pint of the same. Habit. Marketing. Nonchalance. Ignorance. Laziness. The reasons for why people choose to drink Budweiser are many, but that doesn\u2019t mean I understand them any more or any less.

This beer is perfect for tailgating, campfires, the beach and most other red blooded American activities.  I\u2019m also amazed at the consistency of this beer.

After going through all of the good beers at my local French supermarket, and then going through all the bad beers, I was left with one last beer in wide distribution here that I hadn\u2019t reviewed: \"Bud\", as it\u2019s called, \"Budweiser\" to Yankee types. A package of six bottles is twice the price of Heineken, and even a couple of Euros more than six cans of Guinness. Marketing genius indeed, and being a sucker for punishment, I bought six just to remind myself of what it tastes like.\r\nPoured into a Chimay chalice (I hope the irony is not lost on you) after being chilled only slightly in the fridge, this is the yellowest beer I\u2019ve ever seen. Head is soap-foam like, looks a bit like a bubble bath. I think I picked up some corn starch in the smell, a little alcohol, but very little of anything else. Taste? I taste syrup, a little graininess on the back end, a slightly dry finish. I will give this one extra points for drinkability, and then take away even more points for being the most expensive, and worst tasting beer in my local French supermarket. Seriously, double the price of Heineken!? The marketers aren\u2019t taking the piss, they\u2019re trying to sell it. Ha! 2/1/3/2/2\r\n\r\nRe-rate October 31st 2015: \r\n\r\nWell, it seems right to re-rate the classics and \" kings\"  of beers every so often, just for kicks and giggles. I found this 740ml can in Inuvik and while it\u2019s -18 outside and there\u2019s little else to do, why not aproach this brew again so many years later as I\u2019m approaching rating number 2000 and see how my palate has changed - would I appreciate the same things or loathe it the same? There\u2019s good ol\u2019 hockey on the telee so I figger this is what Murricans do down there, suck down a 740ml can and watch the Red Wings trash the Senators. So the massive torpedo-style can pours a boring bad yellow with a foamy head that is gone by the time I\u2019m done typing this sentence. The aroma is metal with vague hints of caramel and lemon, like they\u2019re talking a few doors down in this hotel. Flavour is a vague hint of cornbread. There is this weak, cloying finish and mouthfeel that really makes me question the brew - I didn\u2019t notice this before so much, and perhaps this isn\u2019t chilled \"enough\" for Bud standards, but it really make the drinking experience difficult with those chemicals kicking back up on the aftertaste. Yes indeed - after more than six years my rating is mostly the same, 0.1 less in fact - there are redeeming qualities here in very tiny amounts but it\u2019s still the landmark macro swill that all beer raters describe.

What can i say this beer sells for other reasons then propaganda and availabilty. i dont know what could be more sessionalbe when it doesnt fill you up.  I will say there are major downfalls like the number of times you visit the bathroom the next day but thats what you get for 5$ of punishment to your body.

Purely in the interests of science, I paid $5.00 (!) for a 12 oz. cup of Bud. Rather to my surprise, it was as bad--if not worse--than my memory of it. It came with a very thin, gauzy film on top. The color beneath this was a fairly deep yellow. The aroma was mostly very sour, with a faint hint of sweetness--that faint hint being the only even slightly decent quality the beer had. Flavor was extremely bland and very sour with a nasty, unpleasant aftertaste. The tail was sour and ugly, too, but it was no different than the rest in that respect; I guess you could say I got a \u2019smooth\u2019 cup. Temperature was no excuse for bad flavor in this case; the beer was ice-cold. No doubt it would have been utterly undrinkable warm. The palate was as thin as rice paper and as watery as the Atlantic Ocean. It had me trotting to the loo several items to get rid of it, another Bud effect I recall from the old days. The kick was very mild. Boy, was this stuff atrocious. I have sampled a lot of mediocre pale lagers in recent months: Schaefer, Schlitz, Carling BL, Foster\u2019s, Modelo, Tecate.

Someone left a few bottles of Bud in my fridge, so I knew I had to give my old sidekick an honest rating, and that\u2019s what I did. I should confess that I drank another, from the bottle, and it was somehow more aromatic. But this rating is from a beer mug. \"Born on\" 15 Nov \u201906. I gave it an aggressive pour to help build the head, and release as much aroma as possible. That head was pure white, very frothy, and short-lived. I was shocked to see a few strands of bubbles clinging to the sides of glass, which was the extent of the lacing. The body is crystal clear, with occasional bubbles seen rising, and is the palest shade of yellow I have ever seen; I never realized how truly watery this beer is. Of course, Bud drinkers don\u2019t give a damn about appearance, so I guess this former Bud drinker just never took notice. I very sincerely could not detect any aroma at first. After nearly sticking my nose in it, and inhaling so hard I got light-headed, I was able to catch the faintest hint of cereal, with a skunky note. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, as expected. The only thing separating this from water is the carbonation, which is actually just enough to keep it interesting. Flavor is...Budweiser. Everyone knows it, but it can\u2019t be described. The best I can do is to call it \"unique.\" Finishes lightly bitter, so I guess they actually do toss a handful of hop pellets in each industrial-sized batch. I noticed that some other raters, who gave poor scores, were yet rather descriptive of the aromas and flavors of this beer. I just don\u2019t see it; this stuff is truly empty. My low category ratings are not facetious -- this stuff really is that weak. I once said I\u2019d give Bud an overall rating of 10, just for the label. I lied...but I do still love that label. Rating this swill dropped my \"Average Rating\" below 3, so I feel Anheuser-Busch now owes me something. If they release a halfway decent beer, I\u2019ll be satisfied.

This is the most famous beer in the world - the most popular beer in the world - and the one with more contempt poured on it\u2019s little crowned head than any other beer in the world. It\u2019s the beer used as a yardstick for bad beer - \u2019The Budweiser of Russia\u2019, \u2019As bland as a Bud\u2019, \u2019Almost as bad as a Bud - if that\u2019s possible!\u2019, etc. I was obviously curious. It had been many years since I\u2019d had that other Bud. A distant memory remained, but the memory can play tricks. Also, I had drunk a number of lagers or blonde beers since then and found that a few were quite palatable. I was curious. The colour is not encouraging - the urine sample of an anaemic ant on it\u2019s death bed would produce something with more body. Anyway, the nose, the smell, the aroma is disappointing. There\u2019s nothing there. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s not good. It\u2019s just not there. But the taste was rather surprising. Honey, butter, fresh grass, smooth, creamy, a fizz, quite pleasant... Lacking distinctive character, maybe... or maybe not. I reckon I could tell a Bud from a Corona or a Moosehead. Don\u2019t get me wrong - I don\u2019t think this is a class act. I don\u2019t even think it reaches the heights of an average beer. But it aint a dog. It\u2019s more of a bitch, and when you\u2019re desperate...

I didn't buy it or consume it publicly in odd-lawed America though, so you can rest your sweet peepers from so accusingly gawking. Besides, it's been well over two years and you couldn't try me for that anyway. Budweiser has an unpleasant soapiness to it, I note...perhaps a slightly corny taste (take that how you will), but I agree the malt and hops in it just don't do it for me. If this is the King of Beers, give me the Queen of Beers [Warsteiner, die Koenigen unter den Bieren].

It is the best con job since knotty pine paneling and Bose speakers. In my rural area, all rednecks drink only Bud.  Bring something else to the party and you'll be severely ridiculed or possibly face violence. Offer another lousy beer or a quality one, its all the same. It is like religion or patriotism gone real ugly.  This doesn't speak well of my locale, however I know the same is true elsewhere. The \"10 oz\" Bud is the local favorite.  They think it has a superior taste to the 12 oz can. Rednecks and blue collar folks deserve better, but then again maybe they don't. I've seen mention on this website of Bud being a cheap beer. I don't find it very cheap really, but maybe demand is so high here that it is priced accordingly.
