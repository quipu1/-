Crisp taste with good fruitiness to start with, green apple, apricot and pineapple, medium carbonation, quickly appearing wheat sourishness and \u2019soapiness\u2019, refreshing, light spicy yeasty notes, bready pale malts in the background with a subtle, sweet honey touch; supple mouthfeel, rather thin but this cannot come as a surprise seen the relatively low ABV. The gentle wheat sourishness accompanies the finish aided by a herbal, soft but still drying hop bitterishness, more so than in traditional European-style wheat beers; in that sense, this is, I guess, a typical example of an American wheat.

There\u2019s nothing too dramatic in the taste either; having a mild sweetness throughout, and a light, pleasantly sour note at the finish. Initially tastes lemony with some bread-like flavor to it - maybe some clove-like spice in there too. It finishes closer to apple juice with some orange in it. The initial sips are highly carbonated, and the fizziness keeps some presence throughout, but by the end, it\u2019s a bit more malty and syrupy. Generally finishes clean, although pairing it with food seems to recall the apple traces in the flavor and a very faint hop taste. Although my scores are generally low, this has been a goto session beer for me for a long time, and will likely continue to be so - none of the flavors are overwhelming or offensive, so it\u2019s a crowd-pleaser and it pairs well with just about any food offering without enhancing or masking any flavors.

That said, many people believe that they\u2019ve taken a sharp decline in overall quality since being acquired by AB-InBev in 2011, and their mainstream beers are the ones thought of to have taken the largest hit. Honestly, I haven\u2019t had many Goose Island beers; I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve had their IPA and their Honkers Ale, but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m not sure what exactly makes their 312 an \u201curban\u201d wheat ale, but I\u2019m interested to see what it\u2019s all about.\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance (3/5)\r\nThe beer pours a slightly hazy light gold-to-straw with a bright white fizzy head and dissipates fairly quickly.

At the end there is a faint soapy note.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste (12/20)\r\nGoose Island\u2019s Urban Wheat is definitely light. The taste is definitely that of an American style wheat beer, with bread and biscuit being accompanied by honey sweetness, some lemon citrus. In the finish there is a bit of astringency that comes off similar to a mild dish soap. \r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability (3/5)\r\n312 is slick, but drinkable. The carbonation dies down after a few minutes, and the mouthfeel is light-to-medium. It isn\u2019t remarkable, so I won\u2019t waste too much time.\r\n\n\n\r\nIntangibles (4/10)\r\nGoose Island\u2019s 312 Urban Wheat beer is mild, drinkable, and ultimately forgettable. While I\u2019ll admit that it does have some interesting qualities, especially the light honey notes that are presented throughout the nose and palate, it isn\u2019t a beer that jumps out as anything I would bend over backwards to buy.\r\n\n\n\r\nOverall (26/50)", "writed_at": "August 5, 2013"}, {"user_id": "Squizzle", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc 312", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat Ale", "review_score": 3.8, "review_content": "Drank this six PAC with some friends way late at night and after way too much rum.

A wheat beer, and rightfully named as such, I am glad to see she doesn\u2019t try to claim a German heritage that is not hers to claim. Mixed in with the lemon zest is a pleasing pith and skin bitterness. Light and refreshing, without further ado I put her palate to the test. Soft lemon cream and white breads caress my tongue and mouth, gliding across with supple finesse. Lemon soothes front and middle while white and wheat breads fill her middle and finish. Speaking of her finish, it is clean with little lingering esters to speak of, just a sense of brightness and lemon skin. Coriander and white pepper play in the background, mischief makers that they are, making fast friends with the lemon zest prevalent throughout her whole palate. Clean, refreshing, and even invigorating, I am proud to say I took home a screaming canary yellow 312 Urban Wheat t-shirt to mark the occasion.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is what American wheat beers do best, and also why they are recognized as a style separate from Belgian Wits and German Hefeweizens.

So I tried it with some rolls of minute steak filled with pesto, mozarella and gorgonzolla served in a creamy sauce with rice on the side. It wasn\u2019t a good match at all, the beer got a very odd bitter taste and the food also taste worse. Maybe it was the cheeses that created the weird combo but I think this beer is best on it\u2019s own.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m raising my score a bit since the beer is drinkable and doesn\u2019t have any bad tastes.

Muted grains, a faint yeastiness and dull malt profile form a very safe nose that goes out of its way to not offend even the weakest of noses.  It is bland and offensive which is perhaps giving it a little more credit than it deserves.\r\nFlavor / Palate - Wheat, rye and honeycomb cereal create an ephemeral sensation on the tongue that washes away in seconds.  A faintly bitter finish like the dregs of a package of Fischers nuts is all that remains.  If you focus it is possible to detect lemon juice and orange rinds.
