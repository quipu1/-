Lightly and irregularly lacing, moussy, pale greyish beige head with good \u2019edge retention\u2019, slowly dissipating in the middle but leaving thin veils of foam; very dark mahogany brown colour but black in general appearance, limiting its maroon hue to the edges. Aroma cannot hide pasteurization - the first thing that springs to my nostrils - in a cooked vegetable-kind of way and also reveals a whole lot of tin can-like iron, overseeing less unpleasant aspects of diluted coffee grounds or even \u2019green\u2019 coffee beans, pistachio nuts and peanuts, industrial beef stock cubes and even some gravy, haemoglobin, something sulfuric (egg yolk or even further than that), soggy brown bread, old dusty closets. Sourish and sweetish onset, roasted barley sourishness with dried fig sweetishness but both subdued and surrounded by a somewhat beef stock-like umami edge, softish carbonation, smooth oily mouthfeel, gliding effortlessly over the surface of the tongue, leaving behind a trail of malt bittersweetness, nothing too thick or layered here, just a fairly pleasant evolution from sweetish nuttiness towards toasted bitterishness, roasted in the very end but gently so, while at the same time delivering an unmistakable metallic, iron-like flavor, but not more so than in other variations on this theme I had and not more so than in a regular European draught Guinness. Finishes with ongoing \u2019nuttiness\u2019 and the aforementioned increased roasted bitterness, supported by - as announced on the can - spicy hops but not to the point that they become obvious over the roasted barley; warming, almost rum-like alcohol is there as well producing a sedative glow in the back, nothing astringent or anything like that, but still perhaps a bit too obvious for a 7.5% beer. The metallic edge remains palpable but in a mild, not too obnoxious kind of way. I do not tend to have high expectations from African beers - as long as the international craft beer revolution has not reached it - but this is, all things considered, an enjoyable stout. It has a thicker umami effect and more \u2019moelleux\u2019 feeling to it (but equally strong iron) than the widespread Guinness Draught you\u2019ll find in any overly commercial Irish - or other - pub in Europe; in fact, I think I like this one, certainly the African versions, better.  Feels less industrial than some other of Guinness\u2019 stouts, quite filling and tasty, surely among the best African beers I had so far (which still doesn\u2019t mean a lot, obviously) but lacks some of the \u2019exoticness\u2019 of the Nigerian version I had ten years ago, which differs from other African (or any) Guinness stouts in using roasted sorghum, whereas this one apparently uses the classic roasted barley.", "writed_at": "January 21, 2017"}, {"user_id": "kamil3ds", "beer_kor_name": "\uae30\ub124\uc2a4 \uc5d1\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub77c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc6b0\ud2b8(\uc138\uacc4)", "beer_eng_name": "Guinness Foreign Extra Stout", "review_score": 3.3, "review_content": "Aroma- dark bread, roasty,caramel, \r\ndark brown, nice foam, tall and smooth.

The head is two inches of thick beige head that has long lasting retention. As it gradually subsides, it coats the sides of the tulip glass with sticky lace.\r\n\r\nS: The aroma is considerably weaker than one would expect, given the appearance of this stout. Cream, milk chocolate and malt are the primary scents. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t smell much different than a regular Guinness.\r\n\r\nT: I am a fan of Guinness beer, as it is one of the first craft beers I ever had the pleasure to taste. I would definitely say that the Foreign Export Stout is a better beer than the regular variety so commonly found at the local bar. It is richer\r\n\r\nM: Smooth and creamy, but not as much as the regular version.

But did you know the Foreign Extra Stout is actually the highest-selling version globally? Why it\u2019s never been sold in the United States until recently is something of a mystery. This is a stronger version of traditional Guinness to be sure, but those expecting major differences or more complexity might be a little disappointed. It\u2019s a good beer, but nothing more than that.\n\nI poured a 12oz bottle into an Irish tulip stout glass.\n\nAppearance: Just like regular Guinness, this beer is pitch black and just a hint of ruby red shows when held up to the light. It forms a huge, dark tan, sponge-like head that lasts seemingly forever and laces the glass well.\n\nSmell: A generic stout aroma for lack of a better description. There\u2019s a slight oaty quality and some roasted malt with a touch of black licorice, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nTaste: Much like the appearance and aroma, the beer tastes like a generic, conservative stout - only a little stronger. The first half is quite mild with some sweetness and a dairy-like flavor commonly found in milk and oatmeal stouts (although this is an Irish Dry Stout). The second half kicks the palate with dark-roasted malt akin to the robustness of a French roast coffee. Guinness FES is also noticeably more bitter then regular Guinness and dries out the palate faster too. \n\nMy only beef with this beer is that it doesn\u2019t offer anything original. No chocolate or coffee flavors, just a hint of black licorice in the aftertaste. \n\nMouthfeel: Despite the higher potency and robustness, I was surprised the beer was on the lower end of medium-bodied. Low carbonation and a soft, gentle texture on the tongue.\n\nDrinkability: Almost as good as regular Guinness as it slides across the palate like water. There\u2019s a dry aftertaste which gets a little annoying, but is easily tolerable. The 7.5% ABV seems high as the beer drinks and feels like something more in the sessionable range.\n\nOverall, this is a good beer but nothing particularly special. There are many other options for stouts with the same potency, higher complexity and similar price range.

The dark roasted malt brings a full bodied hit of toasted barley notes with sweet touches of toffee that play well off the slight sweet boozy notes.

Bought one of these at a market our 1st day in St John US virgin islands where we were for a week.

Nursed in a dark plastic bag filled w/ice and dripping everywhere while we sat at the beach bar next to the dock getting our eat and drink on.  About 85 degrees out--not to bad for a late January late morning/early aft.  Lisa and I left the beach bar after a long lunch that included a ribeye wrap, chicken burrito, a 12 oz bottle of red Chimay, 1 sierra Nevada pale ale, 1 virgin islands mango pale ale, and a bushwacker with a chocolarte drawn smily face skull and cross bones on top--YIKES we did a #!!!.  After lunch boarded the Red hook from St John going to St Thomas to catch our flight back home.  w/ the leaky shopping bag that had the foreign stout in it--I thought phuck I hope this is worth the effort...It surely was--a great beer!   \r\n\r\nPoured in 2 cups and split with Lisa.  Dark close to black appearance with a brownish prevelant head.  Great ABV at 7.5 that is well weaved in.  Nose was very roasty and smokey and nutty.  I could tell this one was going to kick ass as soon as I whiffed it.  The taste was just like identical to the nose with great balance and flavor--smooth rounded finish.  We both REALLY enjoyed it and agreed we would love to enjoy it w/the some BBQ food (props to Lisa for calling that one out).  Wish I could get this here.

The beer is quite dark, an almost black color and it is quite opaque when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of burnt, slightly fermented prunes, somewhat acidic espresso and also has a touch of nostril warming alcohol towards the finish.  It is quite interesting how fruity this smells, it is really quite amplified, but it also some how smells thin, if that makes any sense.  If you really dig there are notes of darkly toasted whole grain bread in the finish that adds some much needed complexity, but you really have to dig to find these notes.\n\n\r\n\r\nLightly sweet up front, but this is well balanced by the roast character.  The roasted notes start out soft and smooth, but pick up some bite and bitterness as it flows across the tongue.  The finish sees the burnt bitterness lingering in a nice way as well as having a roasted coffee / bread character to it.  The beer has some viscous heft to it, but it actually seems a bit light for what I was expecting for some reason; the overall dryness and ample roast flavors certainly help to thin the effect of this beer out too.  The fruitiness from the nose isn\u2019t quite so noticeable in the flavor (the ample roast character in the flavors certainly tempers this), but there is still a note of lightly tart plums in the finish that mixes with some warming alcohol notes that also accentuate the soft fruit character.\n\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason I was expecting great things from this beer; I feel quite a bit let down, but in all honestly this is a more than serviceable stout that I am able to settle in to and enjoy.

We also did not drink much beer poured into glasses.  However, from what I remember, FES is a dark black pour with a creamy tan head.  You had to be careful pouring it out of the bottle as it was bottle conditioned and there was a thick layer of yeast hiding on the bottom that was not too pleasant.  The aroma was very strong of darkly roasted malts and coffee/espresso.  Flavor matched that pretty well.  This was a quite bitter beer, to the point of being astringent.  The bitterness lingered as did the coffee flavor.  FES was a lot stronger, but more expensive than the Star Lager, which is mostly what everyone drank.
