Insert the \"making love in a canoe\" joke here.\r\n\n\n\r\nI poured a 24oz can into a 1-liter mug.\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Clear, gold color with some carbonation initially visible, though it goes tepid quickly. Forms a large, white, fluffy head which mostly dissipates but does leave some lacing on the glass.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Totally generic \"beer\" smell, though on the cleaner and less offensive side. Some corn notes, but otherwise odorless.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: You\u2019d think after all these years of drinking craft beer and refining my palate that I\u2019d be able to pick up on the genuine flavors present in macro adjunct lagers, as subtle as they may be. Though I\u2019m finding the opposite is actually true. As hard as I try, I really can\u2019t find any genuine flavors to Miller High Life. It\u2019s a beer that\u2019s much more bland and flavorless than it is offensive. But simply not being offensive does not a good beer make. \r\n\n\n\r\nI think I\u2019d actually prefer the overt rice flavor of Budweiser or the corn flavor of a malt liquor since they give your mouth something to concentrate on. In the case of this beer it\u2019s just a cold liquid with a faint sweetness and a clean finish. Perhaps there\u2019s some canned corn water taste, but there\u2019s definitely nothing in the way of malts or hops.

It\u2019s bubbly when first poured, but proceeds to go completely flat in mere seconds. It\u2019s slightly refreshing while cold, but that\u2019s hardly a redeeming quality or compliment. I couldn\u2019t find a definite alcohol content on this beer, though most sources seem to peg it at 4.5 - 5.5% ABV (I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s closer to &lt;5%).
