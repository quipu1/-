Slick and oozy palate.\n\nMouth Feel: Solid Amber malt in a thick but wheaty background, which slimmed the body considerably (as well as the caramel toffee taste) but not the full Amber bock-ishness. Loads of red fruits with strong grapefruity hops, citrusy spicy and very piney with pretty strong ooze. Flowery with moderate sweetness. Biscuity with strong lime to round. Charming!\n\nHoppiness: Floral, spices, pine, lemon and grass in nose. Grapefruits, citrus, floral, spices, strong pine, resins, lime, and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is strong for a lasting, close to high-level bitter Amber malty finish.\n\nAfter Taste: Quite dry. Limey piney and bitter to mouth.\n\nComments: This one is billed as a Session IPA by the Brewer. How wrong they are: it bears all the hallmarks of a good Strong Bitter, with eye-catching copper color and nice head, strong Amber maltyness with lots of red fruits and toast, plus a matching strong citrus piney bitter hops to boost. Were it\u2019s not being bounded at session strength, it may even make a good case to be a nice ESB.
