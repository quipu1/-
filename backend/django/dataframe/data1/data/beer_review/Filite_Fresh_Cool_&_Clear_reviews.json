They made a solid cheap happoshu style water alcohol with the normal filite. i'm sure that too many ajeosshis complained that it didn't taste enough like soju and cigarettes so they've altered the formula. removed the artificial and one dimensional C-hop aroma, which was the only saving grace of green filite and turned it into effluent. it has a horrendous aftertaste that you can't get rid of. good job ajeosshis. this was definitely in the top 3 worst beers i've ever had in my life if not number one.\r\nno description is possible, just instant drain pour. why do i have to give a 0.5 score?", "writed_at": "May 28, 2018"}]
