As I was checking out, I saw the manager of Publix who I happen to play cards with and asked him if he had Stellas. He said he had, and that he thought it was better on tap. Then I read here some comments that it is better on tap, so maybe next time I'll try it on tap? In the bottle though, was semi-skunky in aroma and first few sips, but the beer itself was smooth and had a decent pilsnery taste. I'd say something like a cross between a Belgian Blonde/Wheat Ale and a Pilsner. Appearance is a light yellow with a bit of an orange tint. I guess it's a decent one if at the bar on tap, with not many other choices in the microbrew department. Don't think I'll be buying in the bottle again though.

When its brewery Artois joined with Jupiler\u2019s Piedboeuf to form Interbrew, a company policy was established to keep the latter on the home market and to promote Stella primarily as the international brand, which, needless to say, proved very successful. It pours a clear light golden blonde with delicate fizz and builds a snow white, moussy head with good retention and cobweb lacing on the edge of the glass. The aroma has some corn but less disturbingly so than in many other mass marketed macro lagers (including Jupiler) and supported by a bready malt sweetness, a slight hint of iron and some cheesy and grassy hops. Taste is crisp and clean, corn and bready maltiness again, slick with a slight sourishness, minerally carbonation and a gentle, yet pleasant \u2019European\u2019 leafy and aromatic (Czech) hop bitterness in the finish, in which the initial maltiness also continues. In all: though just another bland standard lager, this very clearly has a more \u2019noble\u2019 and refined character than Jupiler, if one has to compare. It has a cleaner maltiness, less disturbing corn, less chemical wryness and more genuine hoppiness.

I\u2019m going to review a Stella Artois that I happened to find without the case punctured\u2014no holes in it, so there should be no light that has gotten to it. As you can see, it pours fairly nice, as you would expect; nice carbonation with the bubbles; head retention\u2019s moderate\u2014went away fairly quickly, but it does leave a little white tiny head on the top.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s get some aroma here \u2026 mainly getting some malt, that\u2019s about it. There could be a tiny hint of skunk, which leads me to believe that, maybe, something in the way they produce these in the factory lets the UV light in them, but I\u2019m not sure. Mostly malt is all I\u2019m getting; I\u2019m getting no hop at all on this.\r\n\r\nThe flavor\u2014again, I\u2019m getting that undercurrent of a little bit of skunkiness, very tiny amount. I do get a lot of malt, but it goes into a little bit of hop bitterness. Stays pretty malty with a slight, slight bit of hop bitterness to it; I don\u2019t really get any hop flavor.\r\n\r\nGet another little aroma here since it warmed up a bit \u2026 still nothing but malt, to me. Could be a tiny, tiny hint of some floral hop on there.\r\n\r\nAgain, I\u2019m getting some malt in the flavor, but I do get this tiniest hint of skunk, which leads me to just wonder\u2014I\u2019m not sure what their packaging procedures are, or how it got skunky, but somehow it did. I can guarantee that package was sealed, or I wouldn\u2019t have bought it, because I don\u2019t need to prove to myself that green bottles get skunky.\r\n\r\nMy impression of this beer is it\u2019s definitely a lot better than the skunky ones you get\u2014not as good as the stuff I had when I was over in Antwerp. I\u2019d probably give this about a thirty out of fifty. It\u2019s not terrible. The skunk is not really overpowering. Like I say, I barely get it. Not a great example of this beer, because I know it tastes a lot better in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThere is actually, now that I\u2019ve had it for a little bit in my mouth\u2014I\u2019m getting a tiny bit of paper. I should have checked the date on that one. I don\u2019t have the box anymore, but I don\u2019t believe it was out of date. One thing to look out for is\u2014when you\u2019re buying beer, especially beers that you don\u2019t want to age, if they have a date on them, and most European beers will have that, just make sure it\u2019s not expired. The closer you get to fresh, the better.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d basically say it\u2019s drinkable, but certainly not like I remember it. Again, green bottle beer is terrible. I wish these marketing people would get that in their thick heads and let the brew masters tell them, \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more green bottles.\u201d They look stupid.

Poured a clear, very light yellow with nice carbonation and an average large, white head that mostly diminished and left excellent lacing. The aroma had moderate grain, hay and straw; light to moderate herbal, grassy and metallic hops; but mostly skunk. It smelled like an old man bar with stale beer spilled long ago on the floor. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and slightly bitter; while the finish was light to moderately sweet, moderately bitter and lightly sour with a fairly short duration. There was hay, sour malt, straw, metallic hops, skunk, stale beer, old man bar, pennies, cooked corn and sulfur.

It does have more flavor than most US macro brew or alot of common lagers. Light taste with easy going hop character. It is bubbly and light in the mouth and is very drinkable.

In the USA we have Budweiser, Miller and Coors and Europe has Carlsberg and Stella Artois. Stella is definitely a distinctly European-style brew, but because it\u2019s a mass-market beer it\u2019s only average in quality.\n\nPOUR, COLOR AND AROMA\n\nThere is a special \u201cchalice\u201d glass specifically designed for Stella Artois, but I do not own one, so I had to use a regular pint glass. The beer poured extremely rough out of the bottle and formed a large, bright white, creamy head (this is impressive for a pilsner). The color was a crystal-clear, beautiful shade of light gold with a lot of carbonation apparent. \n\nA problem with this beer is its green bottle which does not adequately protect it from light. As soon as I popped the top I could smell a very \u201cskunky\u201d scent which is typical for green bottle brews. The scent was much more potent than simply a generic, grainy \u201cbeer smell\u201d (which was also evident upon closer inspection). \n\nTASTE\n\nI was pleasantly surprised upon my first swig of this beer because I was expecting a typical dry, bitter, bland, watery taste that pilsners of this type are known for. Instead I got a surprisingly creamy-tasting head with a body that was fairly standard in the pilsner style, but with just a tad more flavor.\n\nThe problem with Stella Artois is this enjoyability is only good for a short amount of time right after the beer is poured. As it flattens and warms the taste becomes blunt, dry, bitter and watery. It claims to be a premium pilsner, but there isn\u2019t much to the palate to suggest neither any premium ingredients nor any high-end, delicious taste. This is a beer that is fine for very short bursts only, and probably even better when accompanying food. Otherwise, the taste is unremarkable.\n\nFINISH\n\nLight lagers and pilsners are not known for their smooth finish, but Stella Artois is a notable exception to that rule. With its creamy head and fairly watery body, it\u2019s no wonder this beer is easy to drink without any friction at all.\n\nBODY\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to get official statistics on this beer, but my sources tell me it is fairly light at 5.2% ABV and 140 calories per serving. I can at least attest from experience that Stella Artois is probably about that light as it had very little effect on me. It was actually quite refreshing in a way and would probably work much better as a summer beer than a winter one. \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nA smooth finish and a light body are nice qualities for a beer to have, but I\u2019d much rather have some real taste to my beer. Stella Artois is only delectable for a limited time and even then it does nothing to impress my palate. . It makes me wonder just how \u201cprogressive\u201d our neighbors across the pond really are if they\u2019re drinking this stuff en masse.\n\nNOTE: watch the video version of this review at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqQqDLFjT4s", "writed_at": "September 30, 2012"}, {"user_id": "nicosaya88", "beer_kor_name": "\uc2a4\ud154\ub77c \uc544\ub974\ud22c\uc544", "beer_eng_name": "Stella Artois", "review_score": 3.1, "review_content": "I really like Stella served VERY cold.

This is not always the case, of course, but it can be easy to forget when one has been scarred so many times by lager mediocrity. Stella Artois from InBev is a double dose of \u201clager prejudice\u201d because she is what I would classify as a macro import lager and, better yet, owned and distributed by the largest corporate conglomerate in the world of beer ownership and distribution. I would be speaking of InBev, of course, those feisty Belgians who most recently bought Anheiser Bush for a few gazillion dollars. In the international world of corporate beer, InBev is loathed even more than Anheiser Bush.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nShe poured a lovely crystal clear golden yellow with a rocky white head which resembled the white caps splashing my face during my virgin Stella Artois voyage a few years ago. A delicate scattering of lace clings to the sides of my glass. Bright and playful, lemon and lime tease while soft white breads, rolls, and orange blossoms perfume the air. Sweet lemon drops transport me further back in time, and I remember why I enjoyed this lager so much. My first quaff has a soft yet bright mouthfeel and a short finish that refuses to linger long; apparently, she has better things to do then to hang out with me. Lemon cream with a spritz of key lime tickles from start to finish while soft white breads and rolls, home-made and not the store-bought wonder bread kind, and green grass gleams under a layer of morning dew. Great balance and extreme quaffability along with no bitter aftertaste and an honorable Belgian lager palate makes Stella Artois a winner in my book, and thousands of others, too.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can lament and deride InBev as much as you want and more often than not for good reason, but before InBev bought the rights to Stella Artois, she was already a winner in her home country of Belgium. I can\u2019t say if her palate or recipe has changed any, though I would imagine it has.

At one point they were inside the brewery and viewing the bottling line.  It was at this point that it was mentioned that all Stella that is bottled in brown bottles is reserved for the Belgians themselves and the green bottles are used for export.  The gentleman who was working there mentioned that this is due to the green bottles having a special treatment to protect them from the light.  This was absolute CRAP!  No amount of special treatment would improve green glass over brown.  I don\u2019t know the real deal here, but if I were to guess it would be that green glass is cheaper to come by and American consumers don\u2019t know the difference between good beer and bad beer so that\u2019s why they use them.

The Oranjeboom was the worst - and with sugar listed in the ingredients it should be - it had not much taste, fizz or head and poured the same golden lager colour as the other two.  I had this beer in Holland and it was better than the Auckland version.  Heineken was the next - slightly more head but not much carbonation.  It had an astringent aftertaste that I associate with processed hops and industrial brewing.  The Stella was the best of the three with a lasting head and a hint of hops.  It amuses me that all three allude to a long brewing history on the labels - O associates itself with 1671, Stella with 1366 (hundreds of years before lager was invented) and H claimes to have been established in 1873 and won a Gold Medal in 1875.  That surely must have been the last time it tasted of anything good.  This long history is probably supposed to divert the punter from the fact that these beers are crap.

Given the price and the country of origin, I was at least expecting mediocrity from this beer and a somewhat drinkable pale lager, but after choking down this early birthday present to myself, this is still just swill, albeit fancy, overpriced swill from Belgium.  Sweet, grainy, doughy and metallic with a fair amount of cardboard in there too for good measure, just in case you were starting to think this isn\u2019t THAT bad a beer.  Oh, it certainly is that bad.  Sweet, bready, grainy nose is equally noxious.  Light-bodied with typical carbonation levels, this beer isn\u2019t even refreshing on the palate.  Pale straw in color, but if there\u2019s one thing this beer does right, it boasts a perfectly clear body.  But then the beer even screws up the potential attractiveness by appearing nearly still in my Belgian tulip glass (which I hoped would help, but you can\u2019t make a silk purse from a sow\u2019s ear).  The white head is of average size on the pour, rising to no more than half an inch, and then quickly receding to a sprinkling of powdered sugar.  A single small strand of lace has the stamina to stick to the glass.  So, there goes one of the worst birthday presents I\u2019ve ever had.  What a disappointment!

The cork was damn hard to get out, and the pop in the end was weak.  Poured a pale yellow/golden colour with a big white head that went away fast leaving scattered lacing (App: -1). Nose... malt and peanuts with hints of maybe cabbage, sulphur and dust. (Aroma: -1).  Taste... fairly inconspicuous, flat, some nice lemony hoppines covering a malty body, some weak fruit, a hint of olive oil, and a nice herbal/grapeseed hoppy aftertaste. The flavor/palate ratings remain the same. You can certainly find a lot worse macro Pale/Premium Lagers, and I can dig the hops used in this, but I\u2019ve had better.
