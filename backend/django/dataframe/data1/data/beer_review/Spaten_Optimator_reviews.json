However, I have had Spaten Optimator many times in the past and it\u2019s only been slightly better than the bottle I\u2019m reviewing now. This is definitely a German doppelbock personified \u2013 plenty of sweet malty notes, slightly nutty, but some bitterness to balance it out. Not bad for an InBev product.\r\n\n\n\r\nI poured a 12oz bottle into a mug. It was bottled on 2/2/14 and cost $2.50 ($0.21 per ounce).\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Beautiful chestnut/mahogany hue. Translucent with carbonation visible. Pours to a two-finger, tan, foamy head which laces and retains somewhat well.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Slight skunkiness from the green bottle; otherwise very malty with an overt lager character.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: The first thing I notice here is the classic macro lager character. While I\u2019m quite sure Spaten Optimator is an all-malt brew, there\u2019s something to it that screams \u201clager!\u201d as soon as it touches the tongue. It\u2019s actually quite tangy at first, maybe even a little sour (I\u2019m chalking that up to green bottle and lightstrike), but it\u2019s easily overlooked. Once I get invested in the palette I start to notice flavors of roasted peanuts, a touch of caramel, maybe toffee. The doppelbock style is actually not too far off from the brown ale style in terms of flavor characteristics and this beer is a good example of that. There\u2019s still some bitterness here, but actual hop flavor is mild. Slightly dry, maybe even a bit metallic. Again, this is a fairly old bottle, so I\u2019ll bet a fresh serving would be more complex and less flawed, but as it stands it\u2019s still pretty good for a relatively inexpensive import made by a macro brewery.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: Spaten Optimator may taste like and ale, but it drinks like the lager it is. The mouthfeel is thin and crisp, but not overly fizzy. There\u2019s a slightly slick or sour aftertaste, but I don\u2019t mind it. At 7.6% ABV there is mild warmth from the alcohol, and it does play a factor in the taste as well.

Lifting the glass to my nose, a thick and syrupy assault of molasses and maple syrup weighs upon my senses. This isn\u2019t the finest of the finest; this is the artificially saturated syrup which comes in gallon jugs at a sleek price to appease all the non-discerning general public. Floating in that tub of sickenly thick and artificially sweet maple and molasses are raisins, prunes, cinnamon sticks, and sliced apples. At the back of his nose is a painful hit of alcohol heat. Already I feel my rather limited respect for Spaten in general and their Optimator specifically quickly spiraling into the usual pit of disappointment. My first quaff is sweet and surprisingly a touch dry, a fact his nose certainly didn\u2019t reveal. Dry cinnamon powder and brown sugar ground super-fine are most evident atop my tongue while his body is thick and heavy with artificially sweetened molasses and maple syrup. The further I quaff, a growing sense of staleness works its fingers into his palate much like a poison slowly spreading through the body of its victim. Stale breads such as rye and pumpernickel unfortunately linger in the background, growing ever more apparent as the maple and molasses also starts to go sour. It could also be that the sweetness is just so overwhelming, so heavy, so thick, and so dominating that I can only handle so much before my body starts to reject what I am apparently trying to torture it with. I\u2019ve tasted enough and I would rather the Spaten Optimator not come back later to haunt me. There are no fond farewells here, just an immediate exit strategy expertly executed.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat can I say but yet another disappointment from a brewery which I have very low expectations for anyway.

An amber \"body\" with a lighter orange, yellowish head. The smell is chocolatey and even is a bit like a mocha. Taste is even more like a mocha with a very dry middle taste but then a very pleasing smooth after taste. \"Mouthfeel\" which is something that I had not even thought of before is very good as Optimator is very smooth. To me, it is more like a meal in and of itself so if you are eating while drinking this then you will get very full very fast. \r\n\r\nAgain, it is my favorite beer of all time.

Tawny pour out of the bottle and a jiggling off-tan head.  More of the same maltiness, less berry, much more toffee with a slight nutty element; low bitterness with no astringency but a rather abrupt finish, flattish there, but dry and matches the malt profile.

The flavor followed the aroma: very sweet and malty, very light level of bittering hops, and unexpectedly fruity. The fruit character really made the beer taste almost like a strong, malty, brown ale - but it was not objectionable, just unexpected from a German lager bier.

This is a very well done example of dopple bock, and one that can be found in a number of US markets both in bottles and on draught. It can actually be found year round in the US, but I really enjoy this one during the cold, winter months, as a rich, hearty, malty lager to sit and relax with. \r\n\r\nSpaten Optimator pours to a beautiful, bright, chestnut color with a thick and creamy head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is rich and sweet with lots of big sweet malty, nutty, and toasty aromas with hints of peppery alcohol. The palate is rich and full on the tongue, with lots of big sweet malt, toast, and nut flavors, on a firm, polished body. Optimator finishes with more sweet malt and toasty flavors up front, then ends a bit cloying with more sweet malt, and a peppery alcohol burn that lingers. \r\n\r\nThis is an delicious, very welll made example of dopple bock, and is a personal favorite of mine, though there are other examples that I enjoy more. I enjoy the fact that this beer, along with Paulaner Salvator is one the most accessible German dopples on the US market, and is a very good introduction to the style. It isn\u2019t the most impressive dopple bock I have sampled, but the Germans have set the bar very high on this particular style, so at the very least this beer can be called excellent. \r\n\r\nOptimator is a wonderful before or after dinner drink, and its sweet and toasty character makes it an ideal desert beer. At the Spatenhof, this beer was a phenomenal match to a dessert of Weissbier Creme, which was a delicious custard made with Franziskaner Weissbier served with fresh whipped cream, fruit and berries.

I was also disappointed in this. My little beer-loving soul made a tiny leap for joy when I walked into the beer room at John's today and saw cases of this on display. (Has this ever been available around here?) I managed to calm down enough to refrain first from springing for a case and then from picking up a six pack, choosing the cautious route of going with just a single bottle at $1.79 for sampling purposes. It's too sweet, not cloying like Sam Adams Double Bock, but just a hair's breadth away from that unpleasantness. It has a pretty good full mouthfeel, the kind you expect from an authentic German beer, but the taste just wasn't all that pleasant. Like Heemer, I think my first thought was also how nice it would be to find a cheaper version of Ayinger Celebrator. But the money spent on Celebrator is worth it. If nothing else, this beer has increased my appreciation for Celebrator, as well as for Kulmbacher Eisbock and Aventinus Weizen eisbock. As I think Heemer and HeyKevin note, there is indeed a certain sweaty sock smell/taste or sourness here that is a bit difficult to identify. Is it in the malt, the yeast? I notice this in just about everything by Spaten, though, even in their relatively more satisfying Oktoberfest-Ur-Marzen. It's a distinguishing characteristic about Spaten and an unpleasant one at that, not unlike a slightly skunked fake German beer like Becks or St. Pauli Girl. I'm glad I tried this, to satisfy my curiosity, but this isn't worth the 10 bucks a six pack it's going for at Johns. (Side note: at the same time I picked this up I also got a single of Capital's WInter Sk\u00e5l, because of the good things I've read lately about the beer and my own inability to remember exaclty what this tasted like. I was surprised to find that I liked the Capital bottle better than the Spaten doppelbock.
