Poured a light yellow with tons of variously sized bubbles and an average, soapy, white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light grain and moderate lime and maybe some salt. The flavor was mostly sweet and acidic with some bitterness, sourness and some salt. The initial flavor was not bad. It was mostly lime and just a tad of salt, but then the finish was awful. It was like watered down Tequeza or flat 7 up poured into a Miller Lite. Thankfully the finish was short. The light body watery at first and then suddenly dry. It had fizzy carbonation at first that later became softer.

It was a very hot series of days, and the store was giving away flimsy Warsteiner glasses with each six pack, but most people seemed to be enamored by the idea of a lime-less Corona \u2013 a minimal effort hot summer beer to help the sweat glands cool the sultry drinker down.  I walked home with a six pack that day knowing that I could take one bottle and the family would guzzle down the rest.  Taking a seat outside in the hot noon sun I poured it into a standard pilsener glass and gave it a go.  I was immediately reminded of a Dairy Queen Limeade \u2013 a staple of my youth.  There is a definite outline of the standard pale lager modus operandi, with all the resplendent corn and buzzing carbonation, but there was also copious lime flavors.  Problem was, Miller attached only the sweet parts of the lime and omitted the tangy, bitter and sour parts.  In other words, they made a beer with a \u201ccitrus flavor\u201d and omitted the citrus flavor.  It seems to me that abjuring the focal point of one\u2019s beer is not a poor brewing chpice.  Without the tangy half of the lime this was nothing more than Lime candy melted in beer.  It was refreshing on some level, but any cold liquid would do in its place.  I was expecting a drink to transport me to Baja or the Caribbean, but the Miller Chill Chelado Style was nothing more than a trip to the local Walgreen\u2019s for a six pack of Miller Light and a handful of lime sour patch kids.

To be honest, I was expecting much more fruitiness in the nose. Taste-tastes like a light beer. I was expecting some saltiness and lime, but the only thing that I get, besides cheap light beer flavor, is just a hint of a hint of lime. At least Tequiza doesn\u2019t hide it weird flavor additions. The nose is bad all the way around-the worst smells in a macro are here-they didn\u2019t even put in enough lime to cover that up.  Finishes with an artificial slap. And last time I checked, it is spelled \"chilada\" and it is a divine dish served at Bueno, not some POS marketing gimmick.

Called some friends, they tried it last weekend, they liked it and so did their visiting relatives.  I liked it enough to google it. Sorry to see negative opinions especially from those who haven\u2019t even popped a top. Now if you are a die hard german beer lover or anything close - all the heavy bitters etc. - you know this is not the beer for you. There is a vast # of taste buds, what may taste great to you doesn\u2019t work for me and so it goes. If everyone liked A one and only beer, what a bloody boaring world this would be. Any beer can turn skunky if it\u2019s old, if it\u2019s been left out in the heat \"get the beer out of the trunk and into the fridge\" or hey man, you could buy one of those things man, it hold ice, keep the beer cold. Yup, it\u2019s rocket science. As far as packaging - having a DTP background I think the design &amp; packaging really works! But then again I\u2019m not the sort to NOT buy a beer and try it cuz of how the outside looks. I like trying new things, you wanna be stuck in yur rut well - \"nay sayers\", go, be gone with ya, just leaves more for me - and folks like me - thanks.\r\n\r\nI thought \"Miller Chill\" a very crisp clean taste. Seasonal? I think it a great spring, summer, fall beer. No, can\u2019t see myself drinking it in the dead of winter but then again, a fire at the ski lodge, ya-maybe. I hope it goes nation wide as I don\u2019t live in the state(s) it is produced. I would go buy some for this weekend if it were available.
