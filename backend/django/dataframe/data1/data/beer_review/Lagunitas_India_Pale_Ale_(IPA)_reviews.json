Color is a light amber or dark golden hue. Nothing special or unusual there. Head, however, is just about perfect. A full finger of fine white foam on the initial pour, and a half finger or so is retained all the way through. Lacing is consistent and long lasting.\r\n\r\nTaste: For the most part follows the nose. A mild herbal note sneaks in on the back end. But many west coast IPA\u2019s are, in my opinion, overloaded on hops that contribute to a piney, grassy, earthy taste. This IPA does a much better job of balancing it\u2019s hop load with juicy citrus notes on the front end and herbal or grassy notes on the back. There is enough of a malt presence to keep the beer balanced, but not enough to overpower and make it a sweet malty mess.\r\n\r\nPalate: Light enough body to be an easy beer to drink, almost like a session IPA in it\u2019s body. But the ABV is very standard at about 6%, so it\u2019s technically a bit high for a session brew. Carbonation is moderate and feels about right for an IPA. Slightly resinous feeling on the tongue. The finish is pretty clean and pleasant.\r\n\r\nOverall: Is it the best IPA I\u2019ve ever had? No, it probably doesn\u2019t take that title. But I am having a tough time finding anything really wrong with it.

The head has a moderate level of retention, fading over time to give a good level of lace on the sides of the glass.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The aroma is big and bold of the citrus hop smells. A large grapefruit hop smell is the heaviest and is mixed with some orange and lemon smells. Mixed with these are some smells of tropical fruits of mango and pineapple as well as smells of a bready and malty nature. \r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins with a moderately malty and bready flavor mixed with a good dose of grapefruit hop. Upfront there is a decent caramel sweetness mixed with the hop and malt. As the taste advances the grapefruit hop bitters more in nature as some of the caramel gets lighter and the grapefruit gets a bit more intense. Toward the end some piney hop flavors bring another hop dimension to the beer and mix with a lighter tropical fruit flavor of mango and pineapple as well as the stronger grapefruit and bready flavors to leave a nice bitter but not overly bitter flavor on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is on the average to just above average side in terms of its creaminess and thickness with a carbonation level that is a bit on the lower to average side. Both the slightly thicker body and slightly lower carbonation suit the hop flavors well, but still allow the sweeter flavors to be detected and help balance out the malty and hoppy flavors.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 A tasty IPA that is fairly easy drinking without any one aspect being too overpowering producing a fairly well balanced brew.", "writed_at": "September 7, 2014"}, {"user_id": "beerguy00", "beer_kor_name": "\ub77c\uad6c\ub2c8\ud0c0\uc2a4 IPA", "beer_eng_name": "Lagunitas India Pale Ale (IPA)", "review_score": 3.6, "review_content": "Pours a nice golden color with 2 finger white head.

There\u2019s two fingers worth of off-white colored head, with okay retention and a soft texture. This head leaves behind nice lacing on the glass.\r\n\r\nS: This starts off pretty malty. Once it warms up slightly, it develops a character of piny, grapefruity hops. The Lagunitas house character is pretty unmistakable - and as always, enjoyable. Their other beers show it off better, though.\r\n\r\nT: The hop profile here is pretty mild: there\u2019s only a slight flavor of grapefruit and pine. What there is, especially post-swallow, is a decent amount of bitterness. Normally, I\u2019m not a fan of this approach to IPAs, but there\u2019s just enough sweetness to balance out the finish. Since there isn\u2019t much malt or hop flavor here, it\u2019s mainly reliant on the house character of Lagunitas to provide the flavor - and while it doesn\u2019t do a great job, it does just enough to make it solidly tasty.\r\n\r\nM: While it\u2019s a touch sweet, it has that clean, crisp feel I enjoy in IPAs. The dryness does a good job of counteracting it\u2019s slightly full body. Carbonation isn\u2019t much of a factor either way.\r\n\r\nO: Solid, but not my favorite Lagunitas offering. Still, its great drinkability can\u2019t be overlooked.

I get something of an overpowering sweetness, with a nice bitterness, but one that is far overshadowed by the sweetness. Pine is present, but only barely, and only if I go looking for it.\n\nM - Medium bodied, and a little slick. Refreshing finish, but too heavy to be refreshing. \n\nO - Mixed bag here. Ultimately it's too syrupy for my palate. I've also had mixed experiences with this 12 pack, the last of which I have chosen for this review. A couple felt wonderful, but as I got used to it the sweetness just became too prevalent.\n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "writed_at": "November 21, 2013"}, {"user_id": "jd543", "beer_kor_name": "\ub77c\uad6c\ub2c8\ud0c0\uc2a4 IPA", "beer_eng_name": "Lagunitas India Pale Ale (IPA)", "review_score": 3.5, "review_content": "Golden-orange with a white head.

Having heard good things I came home with a six pack of IPA and the Hop Stoopid.  Tonight I\u2019m trying the IPA \u2013 if I get adventurous I may try the Hop Stoopid but we\u2019ll see.  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Lagunitas uses short-neck bottles.  Pours a hazy gold with a pretty bubbly little head.  Nice lacing, too.  Color is gold with just a hint of copper.  Aroma is, at least at first, challenging for me to discern.  All I can say is that it\u2019s got a faint hop nose, though I can\u2019t really get anything beyond that.  Orange peel, perhaps.  Maybe it will open up a little as it warms.  Mouthfeel is lightly sticky and lightly carbonated, and the bitterness in this isn\u2019t as moderate as the Dogfish Head I had earlier tonight.  Interestingly enough, I called that one a West-Coast style IPA from the East Coast.  I kinda feel like this Lagunitas is an East-Coast style IPA from the West Coast.  For me the taste is kind of inverted, especially for an IPA.  Heavy malt sweetness starts things off, before hops finish things off.  Sadly, the hops aren\u2019t pronounced for me, much like the aroma.  They\u2019re just \u2026 there.  Maybe the aforementioned Dogfish Head fried my palate a little bit.  Best way I can think of to describe the taste of Laguniatas is that of orange marmalade on white bread.  It\u2019s less assuming than others in the style but a damn fine beer in it\u2019s own right.

What would happen if an IPA had the taste of an imperial but the weight and drinkability of a regular IPA? I suppose the answer would be Lagunitas IPA, which seems to be a hybrid of the two.\n\nAPPEARANCE AND AROMA\n\nThis beer flows very smoothly out of the bottle due to its thick composition. It\u2019s bright orange with some yellow colors around the edge. It\u2019s mostly clear, but slightly cloudy (like a summer day here in Albany \u2013 ha!). The head is off-white, frothy, and leaves generous lacing on the glass and sticks around long after the beer itself has been consumed.\n\nThe aroma is indicative of something much heavier than the beer actually is. I smell a rich floral bouquet with notes indicating rich sugary sweetness from the scent alone. There\u2019s a touch of pine, but it\u2019s more like pine sap rather than pine needles.\n\nTASTE\n\nWhen I took my first taste of Lagunitas IPA I was immediately reminded of many heavier versions of the style I have encountered over the years. The taste is extremely rich and malty with a distinct hoppiness to the body but followed by a dry back end. Overall, the palate is best described as sweet and syrup-like, almost sugary.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is there\u2019s a creamy texture as well as a distinct caramel taste \u2013 but which is responsible for which? This is definitely one of the sweetest and maltiest IPAs I\u2019ve had - which is fine because it\u2019s tasty and refreshing. \n\nDRINKABILITY\n\nIt\u2019s rare that I pay attention to the speed at which I drink a brew, but I was honestly surprised that I was able to slug down Lagunitas IPA so quickly. This is even more surprising considering the mouthfeel is rather thick, but soft. It finishes very smooth despite the bitterness to the palate. \n\nWEIGHT\n\nI did not know the weight of this beer until after I had drunk a bottle of it. From the aroma and taste I assumed Lagunitas IPA was something bordering on an imperial style, but considering the ease of its drinkability and its lack of an effect on me; I knew it couldn\u2019t be too hefty. I was vindicated of this once I discovered this is only 5.7% ABV, which is actually a little light for an IPA.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI have to say that Lagunitas IPA took me by surprise in more ways than one. I was impressed by its versatility and drinkability, and while the palate was definitely inviting it didn\u2019t quite blow me away. However, it\u2019s one of the few IPAs that would lend itself perfectly to sessioning.\n\nNOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18i4c2cGeCc", "writed_at": "March 17, 2010"}, {"user_id": "jesperhammer", "beer_kor_name": "\ub77c\uad6c\ub2c8\ud0c0\uc2a4 IPA", "beer_eng_name": "Lagunitas India Pale Ale (IPA)", "review_score": 3.8, "review_content": "13-MAR-2010, bottle @home, from \"Fish &amp; Beer\".\r\nA while since I had this last.

The aroma is sharply hoppy with a nose that is redolent of pine, the nose is quite nice.  Ah, yes this beer has actually been fermented, what a relief, this beer is nothing like the last one I had.  This beer is sharp and crisp up front.  It leads to a beer that is piney, a bit citrusy, and has a solid bitter bite in the finish.  This beer has a solid malt presence as well, it is lightly sweet with notes of caramel and biscuits.  The malt definitely is faint behind the solid hoppiness though, but it is there and helps to keep the hops from being overwhelming.  As this beer warms up a bit I get notes of apricot, and grapefruit.  Overall, this is quite a nice IPA.\n\n\r\n\r\nMarch, 2004 Rating\n\r\nWow this beer smells like it has not yet been fermented.  A sweet wort smell, that is heavy on the crystal malt.  A bit of spicy hop notes under the main smell, but not much.  Pours a hazy copper color with a prodigious tan head that fades fairly quickly.  Again there is a sweet malt flavor, that is reminiscent of sweet wort.  The beer ends with a bit of bitterness.  I must admit, this is quite a stretch to be labeled as an IPA, a pale ale perhaps but not an IPA.  A light hop flavor and not enough bitterness, this is a bit of a disappointment.  It is halfway interesting, just not close to what I was expecting.  There is way too much residual sweetness and body in this beer, it just makes it too unbalanced.
