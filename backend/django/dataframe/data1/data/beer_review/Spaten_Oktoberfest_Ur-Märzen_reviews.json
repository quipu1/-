The hops and spice remain soft while the lager yeast dances light and a touch earthy on the tongue to contrast all that malty flavor without any hop oil or pine resin. \n\n\r\n\r\nThis is a great oktoberfest that has all the right proportions.

Oktoberfests in August? Tis the season, I suppose. 12 oz bottle poured into a stein.\r\n\r\nA: Pours a crystal clear copper color.

Not the strongest aroma, but thank Jebus it\u2019s not skunked! My hopes are now moderately high for this one.\r\n\r\nT: Truth be told, there\u2019s not a whole lot to this as expected - a light sweetness, some toasted and caramel malt, and that\u2019s just about it. The ever-so-subtle finishing hops give this an extremely crisp bite to it. Nothing complex, but it does what it sets out to do well, and that\u2019s to be drunk by the pitcher. Only a hint of metallic-ness on the finish detracts from the experience. \r\n\r\nM: Light, crisp, and refreshing. The drinkability factor is excellent, and it\u2019s not overcarbonated.\r\n\r\nO: Honestly, while it\u2019s damn solid at its job, I\u2019d say look elsewhere for a marzen, simply because there\u2019s too much of a chance you\u2019ll get skunked bottles.

Most likely this is due to the fact that by the time they arrive here they\u2019re skunky, but also due to the fact they\u2019re just not exciting beers. I really wanted to like Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M\u00e4rzen, but I couldn\u2019t find any genuine redeeming qualities in it. Not that it\u2019s bad (I\u2019ve had worse), it just has an overt lack of goodness.\r\n\n\n\r\nI poured a 12oz green bottle into my OktoBEERfest mug.\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: By far the darkest Oktoberfest I\u2019ve ever seen. Dark amber/brown color; crystal clear; not much visible carbonation. Initially forms a large, beige, soapy head, but it quickly fizzles away leaving next to no lacing on the glass.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Since this is a green bottle it\u2019s no surprise it emits a skunky smell as soon as the cap is removed. It\u2019s not as bad as some others but it\u2019s noticeable. There isn\u2019t much else to it, though, just a generic dark lager aroma with a trace of sweet grain.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M\u00e4rzen doesn\u2019t do anything none of the other German Oktoberfestbiers don\u2019t do. It\u2019s mild, it\u2019s straightforward, it\u2019s only slightly sweet and slightly bitter. The palate is at least noticeably clean here. This is impressive considering how pungent the nose is. Still, I need more than a lack of overt flaws to truly compliment it. \r\n\n\n\r\nAs for the actual taste, again, there\u2019s not much to say. A clean, mild, familiar dark lager flavor pitches the palate. There\u2019s a quick burst of typical German hop spice in the middle, but if you blink you\u2019ll miss it. The finish is essentially the same as the beginning but with just a tad more sweetness. A hint of toffee I suppose, but nothing as robust as many American Octoberfest beers with toasty malts or nutty flavors. \r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: A thin, calm, wet mouthfeel with a clean aftertaste makes Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M\u00e4rzen rather refreshing while it\u2019s in the mouth. I\u2019m actually quite surprised it\u2019s 5.9% ABV as it does not seem to have the weight or body of a beer that big.

To beer geeks though it can mean only one thing: Oktoberfest beers. There is the annual huge event in Germany known as Oktoberfest where beer flows freely and in vast quantities. Not to be left out of the beer festivities, Oktoberfest gatherings of all sizes can be found during its namesake month throughout the great states of America.

Thankfully there was no spillage, and soon my glass was brimming with her dark copper and dull amber-orange body. The head fades into a thin layer on top. The nose has a surprisingly large amount of freshly squeezed lemons and citric aromas. Lemon upfront with hints of bitter nuts and a dank, wet malty finish. Repeated swirls leaves massive trails of brussels lace along the sides of my glass which last from start to finish. Not one to make my Spaten Oktoberfest wait, I delve into her coppery depths and discover that despite the bright lemony and citric nose, very little is found in the palate. Instead a rather thick and chewy mouthfeel and body compliments the overwhelming wet, dank and malty flavors. I\u2019m surprised by how heavy the mouthfeel and body of this particular Oktoberfest. While it isn\u2019t a detriment, I wouldn\u2019t name it as a positive attribute either. The finish is clean and doesn\u2019t linger which definitely helps.

The beer is a brilliantly clear reddish amber hue and shows a bright-metallic, deeply red tinged, copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma has a mix of sweet malty notes and dry, bread-like aromatics.  Light hop notes contribute aromatics of lemon zest and faint herbal / grassy notes to the nose, but this is mostly a malt focused beer.  Lightly browned soda crackers, fresh bread-crust aromas, aromas of fresh crushed malt and a touch of sweet, lightly caramelized grain character seem to be the main focus here.  Not a bad aroma, but somehow leaves me wishing for a bit more depth.\r\n\r\nDry and herbal as it first hits my mouth, it quickly picks up a lightly sweet malt sweetness and a round, rustic bread like character.  Each sip finishes with a herbal hop note that gets a bit metallic and a thin malt character.  The malt sweetness while light is actually fairly rich and satiating, this balanced sweet malt character is exactly what I want to see in this style of beer, though it can be a touch too muted at times.  I like that the hop character plays a significant role here in the flavor; it provides a nice balance to the malt character all the while contributing flavors of soft lemon zest, some light herbal notes, more hay / grass than anything and also a nice, biting bitterness that is found from beginning to end.  Light enough to be quite drinkable, but the malt provides some body and texture to it that allows for the beer to stick just a bit to the palate.\r\n\r\nA solid beer, nothing that makes me get really exited, but a nice beer that I could easily quaff a liter of.  I definitely like that malt character here, even if it could use a little boost; it provides a nice biscuit-like, browned soda cracker flavored, rustic bread crust flavor to this brew that sort of defines things for me.

Marzen is a reddish to deep amber, malt accented, hearty brew, that was traditionally brewed in March, and consumed in the Fall. Wild yeasts would reek havoc with brewers yeast centuries ago, the conditions, and state of brewing beer, at the time, made it impossible for German brewers to brew in the summer months. So they would brew huge batches of beer in March(which is Marzen in German), lager (the German word for store), these huge batches in cold caves, containing natural ice, in the Bavarian Alps. Spaten was the first brewery to do this beer style, UR meaning original. \r\n\r\nSo why go with the Germans? The reason is simple, a step in the brewing process, called decoction. All the German brewers of marzen use this step, and in my opinion, it is a vital one. It gives marzen its signature malt character. Decoction is a process where a portion of the mash is taken from the mash tun, heated to a higher temperature in another vessel, and returned to the mash tun. This step gives marzen very deep, toasty and nutty malt flavors that are the soul of this beer style. Some will argue that these flavors can be achieved through the use of special malts, but I have to disagree. That is why I think the German examples of marzen are by far my favorites, and the best examples. There are domestic breweries that do take this extra step, and their beers rival the Germans. Breweries like Old Dominion, and Victory use the decoction method, and you can really taste the results in their versions of marzen. \r\n\r\nOther domestic breweries choose not to, and you can tell. That is not to say that these versions are not, delicious, hearty lagers, or excellent brews. They just are not the best examples of marzen. Some breweries feel the need to put an Octoberfest beer out, but do not even bother to use a lager yeast strain. Breweries such as Harpoon, and Otter Creek make Octoberfest \"ales\". I fail to see the point of these beers, and I really think they should be avoided if you are looking for a true marzen. In fact, if you check my reviews from September and October of last year, you will see I did a series of reviews on marzen/Oktoberfest beer. \r\n\r\nSpaten UR Marzen, the original, and the one marzen I believe you should start with, pours to a deep amber color with a thick white head, and a moderated amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very malt accented, with aromas of sweet malt paired with toasty and nutty aromas. The palate is firm with more good malt character with lots of toasty and nutty flavors. This beer finishes malty up front with a nice bit of hop bitterness to balance this beer. Spaten UR Marzen is not at all cloying, it is a delicious, hearty lager that is smooth, drinkable, and has plenty of great malt flavor. Again, these signature deep malt flavors come from that extra step, decoction. This beer matches perfect with spanfekel(spit roasted) pork or chicken dishes, sauerbraten, and of course grilled bratwurst. Enjoy this beer, and this great beer style during the Oktoberfest season and beyond.", "writed_at": "January 25, 2006"}, {"user_id": "bfeldmann", "beer_kor_name": "\uc288\ud30c\ud150 \uc625\ud1a0\ubc84\ud398\uc2a4\ud2b8", "beer_eng_name": "Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-M\u00e4rzen", "review_score": 3.7, "review_content": "\"Poured a nice orange/amber color.

In fact, I\u2019ve considered it the de facto standard for Oktoberfest beers all these many years, but that may change because, while I still like and enjoy this beer quite a bit, it has clearly suffered quality loss in recent years.  The problem is, it\u2019s pretty tough to find a really good, readily available Oktoberfest these days, and so Spaten\u2019s may still be my standard, but by default.  It\u2019s malty, caramely, and sweet, but whereas I used to think it was a really malty beer, it seems less malty and more sugary sweet than years ago.  However, the one thing I do love about this beer is the standard German malt profile that reminds me of wort.  You rarely get that in beers brewed in the USA.  There\u2019s not a whole lot of hops in this beer, and bitterness is pretty light, which I think is fine because the sweetness isn\u2019t overbearing and the palate isn\u2019t cloying.  The malty and moderately sweet nose is a good lead-in for this beer.  Medium body, easy to drink, but carbonation levels could be a touch higher.  Amber/copper in color.  Good size to the off-white head, settling down to a thin layer, and leaving randomly shaped patches of lace on the glass.
