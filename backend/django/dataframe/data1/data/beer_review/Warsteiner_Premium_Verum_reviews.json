Aromas of cracker, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Slight fruitiness in the nose, but pretty minimal. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Very clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good. A little thin, but not watery feeling. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a good German pilsener style.

Pop the lid and get a whiff of cabbage family cooked vegetables. After it ends up in the glass it is much more attractive, has a plastic or chemical sterile aroma.

This is interesting and hypnotizing, I hope I just don\u2019t have a bad bottle. I looked in the bottom of the bottle, like a wheat beer, and there is no sludge on the bottom, go figure. Other than that the beer is pale yellow with a ring around the inside of the glass for a head. Very smooth initial flavors. It has the same kind of flavor that the aroma insists. It\u2019s not plastic or chemical in a bad way, it seems very refined and controlled. There is a slight hop or malt bitterness that builds on the back of the throat. Enjoyable with just the right amount of bitter personality. The carbonation provides just the right amount of tingle on the back of your tongue. The bitterness that builds as you drink keeps trying to insult the back of my throat but really never quite gets there. Overall a well mannered refined and cultivated German beer taste.
