What\u2019s surprising is that this beer pretty much tastes and drinks like all the fizzy yellow European lagers it\u2019s trying to distinguish itself from. If you\u2019re expecting Guinness Stout in lager form you\u2019re going to be disappointed. If you\u2019re new to beer and want to try something a little different from the mainstream, then this might work for you.\r\n\n\n\r\nI poured an 11.2oz bottle into a lager glass.\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Opaque black body with dark brown edges. Forms a large, light brown, soapy head which slowly evaporates but not completely and does leave some nice lacing on the glass.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Standard macro lager \"beer\" scent. Nothing skunky or sour, nothing inviting though.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: The Schwarzbier style is an underutilized and underappreciated style, so part of me is happy to see one of the world\u2019s biggest breweries bringing it mainstream. But on the other hand, Guinness Black Lager doesn\u2019t exactly conform to the style very well. In a (literal) blind taste test I bet many people could mistake this for a \"premium\" European pilsner, but with a cleaner taste. That might actually be a selling point to some drinkers, however, \"clean\" isn\u2019t really a complimentary description when it comes to a beer.\r\n\n\n\r\nDespite the label\u2019s indication that the beer is \"cold brewed\" (whatever that means) with roasted barley, there is little in the way of roasty character in the palate here. If you\u2019re expecting a stout flavor or iced coffee taste you\u2019re out of luck. In fact if you\u2019re expecting any distinct flavor at all you might want to look elsewhere. This palate is bland - not bad - just bland. I really can\u2019t pull anything memorable out of it. A bit maltier than your average macro lager, and thankfully no presence of adjuncts, but that\u2019s about it. Mild bitterness through the middle and brief flashes of sweetness in the beginning and middle. Meh.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: While Guinness Black Lager may not look like a typical macro lager, it drinks about the same.

Dark chestnut colour.  Thin head.  The aroma is thin, chocolatey-cookiesh (think Oreo with less sugar) with vague nuances of earthiness/mushrooms.  Light body.  Not of a lot of character.   It\u2019s clean, with some rather vague roasty/chocolatey notes.  Thin finish.  Drinks very easy.

As Guinness Premium, Malaysia. Opaque black-brown with light inconsequential tan head. Straightforward malty aroma is pure grain, bran cereal, slight husk and molasses but not sweet or muffiny. Mild carbonation. Light on the palate. Thin finish but the flavors do not evaporate. The fresh flavors match the aromas of unadulterated and pure dark malts. The flavors and aromas are clean if a bit on the husky, cereal side. Its main fault is being thin. Immature beer but a nice addition to the Guinness portfolio.
