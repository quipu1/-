That malt along with slight lagery hops, hint of lemon, possible hint of grass coming up in burps - absolutely wild. Was not expecting this in the slightest.

The beauty in this beer is its depth and balance of flavour. Unlike its bottled, pasteurised counterpart, the spiciness dances on the palate, working with the carbonation to tickle the tongue. The malt is also rich and unapologetically bold, delivering a wholesome bread and caramel backbone. The fruitiness of this pilsner is also unique: there are definite hints of apple and banana, which add an entirely new dimension. \r\n\r\nWhilst some despise the taste of diacetyl, I firmly believe it has its place - notes of butterscotch popcorn balance the spicy hops, and provide an excellent accompaniment to the malt.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism of this beer is the way in which it was served! Poured straight into the glass, with a thin head on top, the beer oxidises, and the head dissipate too fast. As a result, the bitterness becomes over-pronounced, and the beer loses its delicate balance. Rather, a generous glug of wet foam should be poured into the bottom of the glass, then the rest of the beer should be poured underneath it, providing a protective cap.

Usually they just throw hops to the problems or try some gimmick (barrel aging it or adding some herb). Of course it doesn\u2019t save the beer.

Smooth on the palate. I had four glasses of this before the kegs ran out, which was a sad moment.\r\n\r\nOverall, a markedly different experience than I have ever had with Pilsner Urquell. If you ever have the opportunity to try this beer when it\u2019s really fresh, it is certainly worth your time and effort.\r\n\r\nServing type: on-tap\r\n\r\nReviewed on: 08-13-2011", "writed_at": "October 29, 2012"}, {"user_id": "Carfi", "beer_kor_name": "\ud544\uc2a4\ub108 \uc6b0\ub974\ucf08", "beer_eng_name": "Pilsner Urquell", "review_score": 3.0, "review_content": "Postupn\u011b sem budu dopl\u0148opvat piva, co jsem vypil a zapsal si, chvilku to asi bude trvat a proto k t\u011bm d\u0159\u00edve vypit\u00fdm piv\u016fm nebudou \u017e\u00e1dn\u00e9 \"dojmy\" .", "writed_at": "October 28, 2012"}, {"user_id": "Dommod2011", "beer_kor_name": "\ud544\uc2a4\ub108 \uc6b0\ub974\ucf08", "beer_eng_name": "Pilsner Urquell", "review_score": 3.9, "review_content": "This was a surprise treat, recommended by the barman at All Bar One in town.

First reviewed7/21/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Thanks Steve for contributing to the cause.\r\n\r\nPilsner Urquell pours a transparent golden straw color with a 3 cm fluffy white head. Lots of medium sized bubbles work their way up from the bottom to reinforce the head, which retains well and leaves some nice lace.\r\n\r\nThe aroma has softly sweet pilsner malt, and a relatively complex blend of earthy, musty, and pungent hops. This is not my preferred hop aroma, but I like it better now than I used to.\r\n\r\nThe flavor starts out with a soft pilsner malt that stays surprisingly sweet throughout the sip. A little bit biscuity as well, but eventually the pungent, strong noble hops come into play. A firm bitterness brings a skunky (not to be confused with skunked) ammonia flavor toward the end. The finish is bitter, but the carbonation helps clean it up a bit.\r\n\r\nThe visible carbonation ends up adding a medium crispness to the mouthfeel.

However, even though I\u2019ve been drinking these rather taste and aroma less beers for close to two decades I still find it extremely difficult to differentiate e.g. an Urquell from a Heineken, Carlsberg lager, Tuborg gr\u00f8n or any of the other usual suspects. The Urquell is of course clear, pale yellow, with a fizzy, white, fully diminishing head. There might be some faint traces of grass or other hoppy notes in the aroma, the taste is light bitter and I can\u2019t really pinpoint other flavours than \"typical pilsner flavour\". And that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s nothing wrong with the Urquell: It\u2019s a nice, easy-to-drink beer, but it\u2019s far from special (even though it\u2019s the original pilsner). I think I\u2019ll leave these kinds of beers to tasters with a more fine-tuned than my own nose from now on...\r\n\n\n\r\nRe-rating, 2011-07-04, 4-3-5-4-10=2.6\n\r\nSo, having gained a bit more self-esteem after rating a few macro lagers, I give the Urquell another chance. The aroma is still rather lager-ish, but it\u2019s not a 3: up to 4. The taste is medium sweet followed by a medium bitterness. Crisp, clean flavours. Spicy hops, sweet malty caramel and honey, quite nice! Up from 4 to 5. Very nice palate: medium bodied, not overly carbonated: up from 3 to 4. The overall is up from 8 to 10. A decent pilsener.\n\r\n[50 cl can, from Kiwi, Valle, Oslo]\r\n\n\n\r\n2. re-rating, 2011-08-05, 5-3-5-4-11=2.8\n\r\nThis beer keeps getting better and better\u2026 The malty sweetness of this beer is really unusually nice for a lager! The subtle caramel hints in the aroma and the caramel heaven in the flavours are remarkable! The aroma is up from 4 to 5. It\u2019s a bit too much to award a 6 for the Taste, so it stays at a very solid 5. Instead I up the Overall from 10 to 11.\r\n\n\r\n[50 cl can, from ICA Hasle, Oslo]", "writed_at": "August 6, 2011"}, {"user_id": "prawlie", "beer_kor_name": "\ud544\uc2a4\ub108 \uc6b0\ub974\ucf08", "beer_eng_name": "Pilsner Urquell", "review_score": 2.1, "review_content": "500 mL bottle at home poured into a pint glass.

Wow. She eventually fades into a small ring around the glass with a few clouds floating on top. A couple swirls and she foams up nicely. The nose speaks beautifully of grassy hops with lemon and citrus esters. A quaff of her sweet and slightly creamy body yields a richly crisp array of hop oils and sweet, freshly cut grass sit up front while lemon and citrus mingles in the background. A clean finish with only a mild afterimage of hops and grass. Light on the tongue and in the mouth, there is enough body to put Pilsner Urquell above a light lager, just as she should be. Further quaffing reveals an almost perfect balance between the grassy, citrusy, oily hops and the undertones of sweet malts for that slightly nutty caramel soft palate. Sometimes I like to savor my beers, but I find myself quickly at the end of my glass of Pilsner Urquell and wanting another. \r\n\n\r\nWhile Pilsner Urquell is available domestically, it is a pasteurized version available for import.

The Polish version is a very tasty Bohemian Pilsener but Czech one is considerably better.

I would agree with those noble altruists that it is something like a fragile child in a world of more muscular, mature and intelligent beers.  I simply disagree about nurturing its confidence back using self-defeating lies.  It isn\u2019t a pale lager, and has no business scratching desperately for mediocrity with that lot, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the paramount example of Pils primacy that particular members portray it as.  My notes on the beer are brief, as was the time I had with it, but they are not complimentary.  It was a clear and lucid beer (maybe more so than your averaged canned beer) with a frothy white head.  This bubbly top had an entertaining way of weaving a nice webby pattern of lace down the glass as I finished it which helped dispel some of the prejudice I was holding against it.  The smell was blander \u2013 a pretty simple base of mineral water with a strange component to it which I can only explain as giving the beer a \u201clurking\u201d sense about it.  Not necessarily evil lurking like Jack the Ripper lurking, just\u2026 like lurking to sneak into the kitchen and eat the last slice of chocolate cake kind of lurking.  The taste seemed very fresh and dry but missing most of any flavor, opting to go in the other direction and actually taste bad.  Maybe I was drunk by this time but my notes read \u201cTastes like polluted rain water filtered through crypts\u201d.  I don\u2019t remember it being so offensive that I actually thought it tasted like damp necrotic flesh, just that it didn\u2019t taste very good.  Any slew of industrial elements put together with some kind of mold or dust would do the job just fine.  I seriously wonder if my bottle was somehow tainted because the reviews seem to be a great deal more positive than I would have it.

It\u2019s the most popular beer in the city, and often the only beer sold. We got it from many different bars, but the first one - a random bar in the Jewish Quarter, a short walk from our apartment - was stunning. A huge foaming mug of fresh, fruity, thirst-quenching lager with a pleasant hop finish which manages to catch the beauty of a fresh hop - even if that hop is Saaz! I\u2019m not a fan of Saaz, but here it\u2019s woody resin with hints of clove, rosemary and thyme is simply spanking! Part of the delight is due to the low, soft carbonation, and the soft creamy foam which appears natural rather than forced. The pleasure of each pint remained fairly constant, though never quite matched that first experience, and reached it\u2019s lowest point at the airport where it perhaps wasn\u2019t kept as fresh as the much cheaper city bars.

But this, I actually liked, which I wasn\u2019t expecting.  It sure is the \u2019original pilsener,\u2019 ain\u2019t it.  PLZEN!, spake the beer bottle.  Sort of the standard-bearer of what\u2019s good for the style without getting specialized (like the Prima Pils).  I was skeptical of going after bottles of this because of the green bottle, but I bought a 6-pack and have had 2 so far, and no problems yet.  What can I say: it\u2019s just real pilsnery.  I don\u2019t have the hop lingo down, but I believe this one falls into the \u2019floral\u2019 category.  Good, enticing aroma, pretty uninteresting appearance, though.  Golden.  That\u2019s about all I can say for it.  No head.  But taste is most important, and this has got a robust enough taste to hold my interest.  Nice mouthfeel and all that, yadda yadda yadda.  What\u2019s interesting is how an \u2019inferior\u2019 lager can sort of beat up on one of those \u2019superior\u2019 ales in a back-to-back taste test.  Had an ESB right before this, and not all ales are made better than lagers, folks.  Well look at me, I\u2019m rambling again.  Well, that about does \u2019er.  Wraps \u2019er all up.  And it was a purty good story, too, wouldn\u2019t you say?  Hope you enjoyed yourselves too.  Yeah, I found this beer so durned interestin\u2019, that I\u2019d buy it again.
