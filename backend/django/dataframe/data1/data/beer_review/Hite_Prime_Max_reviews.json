[Courtesy of yespr, thanks buddy] Average fizzy white head that mostly lasted. Clear sparkling body with a pale golden colour. Aroma of sweet fruit, malt and grain.

Pours a very deep and lively gold with a nice white head.  First impression of the nose presents hints of sweet corn and sugary malt.
