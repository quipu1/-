Tsingtao Brewery was founded by German settlers \u2013 German brewing traditions appear to play still a significant role in Chinese brewing \u2013 in 1903. Its original name was actually even Germania-Brauerei (Germania Brewery). They are currently the second biggest Chinese brewery, claiming 15 % market share. Ownership appears to have been rather volatile over the years but Asahi appears to own the majority of the company these days, which must sort of hurt \u2013 I assume that most Chinese consumers are oblivious to these fact &amp; most non-Chinese as well I am willing to bet. This beer here is their flagship and is supposed to be a pilsner, it is no longer brewed according to the Reinheidsgebot nor by using mineral water from the Laoshan Spring, this is a bit unfortunate but these days this is mostly just a big factory lager. Beer wise this remains still Chinese biggest export, I am certain that quite a few people will have no difficulty recognising and naming this beer, no other major Chinese export beers come to mind to me personally. The beer itself comes in a green bottle, perhaps aiming to play in the same \u201cluxury\u201d import market as for instance Heineken does in the states? I must add that the cap is in a lovely communist red. Anyway this hit has been a very, very long time I think since I drank anything that comes in a green bottle \u2013 I cannot say that I really missed it. As most export versions over here appear to, my version also states an ABV of 4.7 % The price was reasonable compared to similar offerings &amp; taking the transportation costs into account. Poured into a catastrophically inappropriate glass, the beer itself is an unpleasant, extremely pale macro pilsner yellow, like the lightest cider outside with some non-lasting white bubbles for a head \u2013 it looks like a bottom of the barrel macro pilsner, it has been a while for me \u2013 this is unabridged, real deal. Smell is surprisingly not skunked but rather sweet, sweet, sugary, lemony urinal cakes with some grass and very cheap pastry. Taste is bitter watery grains, cardboard, hay, light bitter aluminium, old apples, that part is ok but unfortunately the aftertaste is rather horrendous, it has this gross chemical, artificial sweetness going on, like baking powder mixed with industrial warehouses, it has this bizarre sweetness to it, lightly metallic, you sort of get used to but the first couple of sips hit you. It feels stale with a definably noticeable watery side to it. What can I say, this is like the poster boy for factory made mass, industrial pale lagers, this is exactly what pops into my head when I think of these kinds of beers. This is what people drink ice-cold from the bottle whilst looking for a relaxing, slow, cheaper buzz.  This reminds me of Stella Artois. This can become almost agreeable, it is not that atrocious, unfortunately I do not feel like I am drinking the beer of the Chinese factory worker, this is what the city yuppies drink in China &amp; privileged kids.

But if we must name a Chinese beer, Tsingtao is pretty much the only one most people (connoisseurs included) can name. As is the case with most countries, their most popular beer is a completely generic, uninspired, pale lager. \n\nPOUR, COLOR AND AROMA\n\nThis brew pours rather rough to a bright white gold, clear complexion. It\u2019s bristling with carbonation and forms a one-finger, bright white, fizzy head which dissolves quickly and almost completely. The carbonation also calms down rather quickly. The scent is a bit skunky, which isn\u2019t surprising considering the fact it\u2019s packaged in green bottles. Compared to others of the style it\u2019s actually quite subdued, but otherwise there isn\u2019t much worth mentioning since it\u2019s just a typical grainy \u201cbeer smell.\u201d\n\nTASTE\n\nIn the United States, certain macro breweries like to market their beers as tasting \u201ccrisp\u201d and/or \u201cclean\u201d as if such adjectives were compliments. I would use both to describe the taste of Tsingtao. This is a pale lager, after all, supposedly based on the German pilsner style. Those looking for something distinct in the palate will have a tough time finding anything.\n\nSurprisingly, this beer does not have a rice-like flavor since rice is apparently not used as an adjunct ingredient. The bottle boasts \u201conly the highest quality malted barely, hops, yeast, and pure mountain water\u2026\u201d If this is the highest quality China has to offer, I\u2019d hate to taste what the lesser-quality beers taste like. However, it does have a slightly sweet taste, but it\u2019s extremely faint. Like most lagers of the type, water seems to be the predominant flavor.\n\nFINISH\n\nWith a very soft mouthfeel and a smooth, easy finish, it\u2019s not hard to understand why Tsingtao is such a popular brew. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that drinkers, en masse, would much prefer a smoother brew to a tasty one.\n\nBODY\n\nThis beer drinks and tastes like a typical American light lager, and yet it\u2019s a bit heavier at 4.8% ABV and 157 calories per serving. I drank a 22oz bomber bottle very quickly and felt almost no effects whatsoever. \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to appreciate about Tsingtao and yet it\u2019s not a beer that\u2019s easy to hate, in fact, my reaction is almost complete indifference. I think it would work fine a session beer, or as a compliment to Chinese food, but otherwise there\u2019s very little here to enjoy.\n\nNOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9caOYDDaAc", "writed_at": "October 21, 2012"}, {"user_id": "rand", "beer_kor_name": "\uce6d\ub530\uc624", "beer_eng_name": "Tsingtao", "review_score": 2.3, "review_content": "Bottle 330 ml from Casino Supermarket in Cernier (CH).

There is good reason for that. When the Chinese and other Asian countries decided to start breweries, they hired Germans as consultants and brew masters to teach them. With their knowledge and brewing skills, came German beer styles. In fact, there is a very rare dunkel or dark lager version of Tsingtao, that these days has proven to be almost mythical. Michael Jackson, the Beer Hunter, swears he has had it in America, in a NYC beer bar years ago. I\u2019ve never seen it, but sure would love to try it some day. You won\u2019t have a problem finding the Tsingtao I am reviewing here today. I dare you to find a Chinese restaurant that does not have it. \r\n\r\nTsingtao pours to a beautiful, bright, pale golden color with a tight white head that fades, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very balanced with some crisp pilsner malt aromas paired with subtle herbal and grassy hop aromas. The palate is crisp and clean with just the right amount of grainy pale malt flavors, and just a hint of malt sweetness. The body is very round and smooth on this beer, making it very drinkable. Tsingtao finishes with more crisp malt flavor up front, then ends with a slightly herbal hop bitterness. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a very nice balance of malt and hop character in this beer, and it is a very food friendly dish. This is the kind of beer you could match with anything from Kung-Pow chicken, sweet and sour pork, to shrimp low mein.
