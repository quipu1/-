Upon pouring there is a very small white head that fades quite fast leaving a bit of patchy foam on the surface of the brew and some very light lacing on the sides of the glass.\r\n\r\n Smell- The aroma is bready and hoppy with a very light level of sweetness. The bready aromas of are of a biscuit and slightly doughy smell while the sweet are of a light caramel smell. The heaviest of the aromas, the hop, are largely of a grapefruit nature mixed with some lighter noted of a pine hop.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins with flavors of a mix of tropical fruits and a pine hop taste. The pine starts the taste rather strongly and lasts to the middle of the taste where it starts to be overwhelmed in strength by a grapefruit hop taste. While this is occurring the breadiness of the brew gets stronger while the fruit fades and its place being taken place by a light caramel flavor. More toward the end, where the grapefruit is rather strong, some more pine hop comes to the tongue and actually competes with the grapefruit in strength. It is accompanied by some more herbal hop flavors with a slight alcohol taste, which in the end, leaves a rather resinous and moderately drier hop flavor to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is on the medium to slightly thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is average to slightly above average. The thicker body really accentuates the resinous hops and more bready flavors that develop more toward the middle. While the higher carbonation suits the fruit and caramel flavors well these are really not the focus of the beer and a slightly lower carbonation level may have been slightly beer for the style.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 A fairly tasty double IPA. It drinks pretty easy and has a decent drier flavor profile (especially at the end of the taste).

Bright ivory in color, the foam is lively and leaves behind a nice sticky lacing. The aromas are bright and zesty, full of citrus, floral and grapefruity hops. The aromas are bountiful, but very soft in nature; this is one of the sweetest/most pleasant smelling IPAs I\u2019ve ever put my nose in.\r\n\r\nOn the palate the Lagunitas Maximus is very similar to the aromas. Very bright and flavorful hops are dominated by a very soft, smooth, and citrusy style of hops. There\u2019s a slight hint of spice in the mid-palate, with a touch of malty sweetness on the back-end.  Much the same way that DFH 90 Min is a hoppy yet sweeter style IPA than the 60 Min, this Maximus brew is a little bit on the sweet side.

This is definitely not a one dimensional beer. There is real malt character here. Whether or not that is appropriate to the style is up to personal taste but I like it just fine. The fine carbonation cuts it and keeps it from cloying, allowing the hops to shine just as much.
