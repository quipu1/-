On the bottle we get \"World acclaimed Asian lager\u201d, born in Singapore and this is an \u201caward winning full bodied beer\u201d.&nbsp;\n\nOn the pour I am getting a nice clear golden coloured beer with a white head that is a little on the small side. Some slight carbonation. Ok on the looks.&nbsp;\n\nThe aroma is not great, very light, an ok lagery smell, all malty and grainy on the nose but too light and a little too much corn and very sweet.\n\nThe taste is easy enough to appreciate, was very soft on the tongue, nice and crisp.\n\nNice frothy mouthfuls initially, and also getting some corn in the taste.\n\nTasted like a regular lager, no real complaints there. Perhaps a little creamy off taste but generally it was ok. Getting the malts and grains, and the fruits, with the hops on the low level.\n\nTo be frank I was a little disappointed as the overall taste was ok but nothing too exciting, a bit bland in fact, nothing to set it apart from the millions of lagers out there. Disappointed as I have had this beer many a time when I was in Asia. In fact it was my most favourite beer that side of the world, lovely from the taps. I just guess it doesn't travel well, and not so exciting in a bottle thousands of miles away from home. Perfect for the hot humid Asian cityscape, not so when its piddling down in bog town Ireland!\n\nOverall it was light, smooth and drinkable but with no kick or standout features.

Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Touch of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a delicious Euro pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt showcase, and nice noble hop presence/balance for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example.

Above average carbonation is present.\r\n\r\nA fairly light, mostly adjunct smell. More specifically, I would say it has a slightly sweet corn smell. No real hop or malt to speak of.\r\n\r\nA consistent flavor from start to finish. I actually thought the sweetness from the corn in the taste was an improvement over the normally awful tasting beers in this category.\r\n\r\nOnly a small amount of texture and not entirely smooth. A fair amount of carbonation reminds me that I am drinking a fizzy Asian lager. It is light enough to be ok, though.\r\n\r\nSome of the beers I have had in India and Asia are so bad that I can not even finish one.

This beer is from Singapore, but it\u2019s called Tiger. That\u2019s funny.

Appearance (both poured simultaneously into identical chalices): a clear win for Classic Edition. TL arrives with a watery gold body and skinny head that vanishes immediately. CE is brighter, deeper and has a head that not only lasts but also laces. TL 2/5, CE 4/5. Aroma: TL is sugary sweet, with cardboardy malt. Uninspiring. Can it get worse? Surprisingly, yes. CE smells stale, despite being well within its \u2019consume-by\u2019 date. It\u2019s fruity, with some wet dog. TL 3, CE 2. Palate: TL is surprisingly oily, with a dry finish. CE is fizzier. TL 3/5, CE 3/5. Flavour: TL is all sugary cornwater, with faint banana and a dry, mildly grainy finish. CE benefits from the crystal malt, but marginally. It has Juicy Fruit chewing gum and canned pear notes. It\u2019s much maltier and just as sweet. TL 3/10, CE 4/10. Overall: I expected the Lager to win this hands down, but there was no contest.
