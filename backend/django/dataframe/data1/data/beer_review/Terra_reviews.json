They release the most superfluous bad beers here, even though they come out so rarely you'd think there was a lot of thought involved in them. what the hell is this supposed to be? you already have cheaper happoshu that fills this category and tastes noticeably better than this. the \"100% real carbonated beer\" is perhaps just trying to insult the customer even more. korea never learns.", "writed_at": "April 4, 2019"}]
