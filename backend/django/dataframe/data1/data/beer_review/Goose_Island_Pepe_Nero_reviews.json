The head has huge carbonation bubbles entrapped within, which slowly pop over time to leave a light level of lacing on the sides of the glass\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The aroma is bready and yeasty with hints of some apple within. Accompanying these smells are notes of banana and some dark chocolate smells.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste starts out with a smoother blend of roasted malt and hints of chocolate. It begins without much of a saison taste, only to develop it more as the taste advances beyond the initial. Some fruit flavors come to the tongue rather quickly off the start being mainly of a banana and light fruit flavor. These remain rather light and are soon meet with some grassy and herbal tastes. A yeasty taste also soon comes to the tongue with the flavor now starting to develop more of a saison like flavor. In the end some bitter chocolate with an increase in a more bitter herbal flavor and some black pepper come to the tongue. These flavors all combined in a rather awkward way to leave a rather odd dark roast, light fruit and bitter herbal flavor to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is quite light with a carbonation level that is on the lower to medium side. This is a tough one as I can\u2019t say if a creamier body for the roasted flavor would have been better or if staying with a thinner body for the fruit, yeast and herbal flavors was the better rout to take. The same goes for the carbonation.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 Well nothing I really cared a whole lot about for the price that you pay.

It\u2019s over one and a half years old, so fingers crossed it\u2019s held up.\r\n\r\nA: Pours a hazy chestnut color with tons of evident carbonation. The head is a two finger mocha shade. Very airy in texture, it retains itself quite well - fantastically, even. Leave it sitting long enough, and excellent lacing will be left on the glass.\r\n\r\nS: A one-two-three punch of caramel, chocolate, and nuts really come through once this warms up. Before that, the aroma mainly consists of bready Belgian yeast and just a touch of black pepper spice. Not really getting how this is even a dark saison - this smells like a Belgian brown ale with some spiciness. Pleasant nonetheless.\r\n\r\nT: The flavors seem to reveal more in the way of roasted coffee notes, especially around the midtaste. It opens with bready yeast flavors, developing a faint fruit quality (apples, pears, white grapes) right before the roast takes over. Chocolate, caramel, and sliiight (emphasis on all the i\u2019s, it\u2019s faint) cherry esters come out on the aftertaste. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if the pepper notes have died down with age, because I\u2019m not picking them up on the flavor profile. Overall, there\u2019s a modicum of complexity, but none of the funk notes I like in my saisons.\r\n\r\nM: Wow, this is strongly carbonated. It can be a bit much at times, but it also has the positive effect of drying the beer out very well. The lightness of body helps all that carbonation come through even more vividly. Okay, now I\u2019m more inclined to believe that this is a dark saison - the mouthfeel is (nearly) dead on, helping to accentuate the coffee notes quite well.\r\n\r\nO: Dark saison or really dry, fizzy Belgian brown? I don\u2019t care, this is damn good. It lacks some of the fine-tuned sophistication to make it a true great of the style (...whatever that style is), but considering I got this on clearance, that\u2019s really a moot point.

Goose Island Pepe Nero is proof of that. It\u2019s a Belgian-style saison brewed with rye and peppercorns to give it a dark body and a hint of spice. Though there\u2019s nothing particularly off-putting about the beer there\u2019s just nothing holding my attention. \r\n\n\n\r\nI poured a 2011 vintage 12oz bottled on 2/24/11 into a tulip glass.\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Dark opaque black body like a stout. Forms a huge, khaki, fluffy head which slowly dissipates, and does leave some lacing on the glass.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: A slightly stout-like scent from a distance, but a closer inspection reveals typical Belgian farmhouse aromas and a hint of dark fruit.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: A beer like Goose Island Pepe Nero probably would be best tasted blind (literally). Seeing the dark, stout-like body, but tasting a fairly typical golden saison flavor really messes with the senses. It\u2019s brewed with black malt, not roasted malt, so you get no stout flavors (not that you\u2019re supposed to, but there\u2019s a certain Pavlovian effect imparted by a beer\u2019s color). The entire palate is classic saison flavor that\u2019s lightly bitter, but quite \"zesty.\" The use of peppercorns should add some spicy heat to this brew, but all it really does is make the finish drier.\r\n\n\n\r\nPerhaps the underwhelming flavor is due to the fact this bottle is about 20 months old and even though it\u2019s bottle-conditioned, it just doesn\u2019t age well.  I\u2019d imagine a fresh bottle would make great use of the rye and peppercorn spiciness. I\u2019m not a big fan of saisons to begin with, and I definitely appreciated the originality to this palate, but there\u2019s not much to it that\u2019s impressing me. \r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: While the flavors might not wake up your mouth, the actually delivery of the beer across the tongue likely will. Goose Island Pepe Nero is definitely using Belgian yeast which makes it extremely foamy, fizzy, and spastic in the mouth. There\u2019s a dryness to the character all around and a slightly chalky aftertaste (though tolerable). There\u2019s a high amount of fine carbonation here,  but it still goes down surprisingly smooth. I think the rather low 6% ABV weight does the beer a disservice since it might need more energy to make use of its potential.", "writed_at": "November 14, 2012"}, {"user_id": "GarrettB", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ud398\ud398 \ub124\ub85c", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Pepe Nero", "review_score": 3.6, "review_content": "May 16th, 2011 - The black IPA was a tremendous leap in my beer tasting adventures, but a dark saison seems almost a little crazy. What will happen to those light and breezy grainy flavors? How will those flavors that taste like a captured sunset turn if they\u2019re mired in dusk and darkness? Yet, if my philosophy is to give everything a try, no matter how small or pedestrian, then I am obliged to sit down with a glass of the wildly innovative. And in all honesty, I\u2019ve always loved beers that try to combine sleek, subtle dark flavors with brighter, fuzzier tastes and melded on a palate that accommodates both. This beer, true to its official title, is a deep, light-gobbling black, with a great, massive head that rushes out of the top of the glass and down the sides of the glass. A little Pompei action never hurt anybody (excluding the town of Pompeii) so I advance to the nose. It\u2019s a creamy aroma, sweet, almost like a milk stout, but smoother and lighter with lots of dark notes, but light and ephemeral and hard to describe. The sensation is like writer\u2019s block - I just can\u2019t put my pen around it. The flavor is easier to put into words: silky body, but thick, like silk doubled over itself, with a light grainy flavor, and a long dry hopped aftertaste. There\u2019s a wood dryness too, but I think what really makes this different from a standard saison is a quiet, more muted take on the blend of grains. I also detect fewer spices, possibly because they\u2019re contending with a roastier body.

The beer is a concentrated, chocolate brown color that shows some clear, amber hues around the edges if you hold it up to the light. The aroma smells predominantly of fruit, with plums and apples being most noticeable, up front, but there is a background note of spice and dark malt to round things out. The nose is slightly musty, a bit pepper like, there is an herbal / floral note here, as well as a subtle, dusty cocoa note. The malt here is quite a bit more subtle than I would expect from a beer with this color; once you really dig for it notes of chalky, whole grain spiciness come out as does some brown grain huskiness, and the aforementioned cocoa character.\n\n\r\n\r\nThis has a lively carbonation and is fairly light bodied. Up front the beer has an ample fruitiness that boosts the perceived sweetness. The finish has a light tartness that is accentuated by the carbonic acid, and there is a hint of bitter dark malt notes. The tartness &amp; fruity esters combine to produce flavors of floral plums, a definite raisin like character. While I usually like my Saisons quite spritzy, the zippy carbonation here actually clashes a bit with the dark malt character; degassing this beer a bit helps to smooth things out. The finish has some estery and higher alcohol notes that add a certain bite to the finish, and there is also a phenolic, clove like character that is fairly noticeable. There is also a dusty cocoa, and brown malt astringency to the finish. The finish really has a certain spiciness to it, the spice character almost has a pungency to it (though that seems like the wrong descriptor in some way), and is definitely a bit woody; actually the piquant spiciness is found from the begging through to the end of each sip now that I have pinpointed it.\n\n\r\n\r\nBetter than I expected, as I was expecting this to be like Demolition or Pere Jacques; luckily this is a bit better than that, and something I am certainly enjoying. I like that the roast malt is fairly restrained, it definitely contributes to the acidity in this brew, and it provides a dusty, slightly roasted, hole-grain rusticity to this brew that works fairly well. The fruit character is really the dominant note here by a fairly big margin, but I like that it is well supported and that this beer still manages quite well to be balanced.

The flavor is similar with lots of smoky grill notes (think of how a prime rib might smell if slow roasted on a charcoal grill...), dark breads, still black pepper all over, a slight raisin note with a moderate acidity, and maybe a bit of toasted caramel in there somewhere.

The beer finishes dry with the smoky/roasty notes diminishing slightly allowing the pepper to balance and the quenching acidity to present itself.  Not your everyday saison...  I usually find that dark saisons dry out to much and taste ashy or chalky but these one was neither.  And the way the smoky notes were used was quite interesting to me; tasting like notes you would expect from grilled meat but not meaty tasting, if that makes any sense.

Body is fairly light and almost thin at times, but very easy drinking. Light carbonation and mostly clean. Overall, a cool beer. Lighter with a nice spice and estery, yeasty fruits.

Some bready malts with a light sweetness, a touch of peppercorn, and just a hint of toastiness. Flavor is similar. Estery dark fruits up front with a lightly spiced Belgian yeastiness. Lightly sweetened bready malts in the middle with a touch of caramel, a light earth, and a few floral peppercorn notes.
