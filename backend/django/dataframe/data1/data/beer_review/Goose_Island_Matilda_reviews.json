The beer is golden amber with a minimal white head, frothy and penetrable. It clings heavy and wet to the tilted glass, and I draw a mouthful of the light-bodied brew, feeling the foam cling to my lip as I pull at the beer. The initial taste is an earthy barnyard character, a hint of banana and sweet dough that\u2019s summed up in a dry swallow. There\u2019s a light hops bite on my gums and the tender skin on the inside of my lips, but the dry finish eases that sting quickly. The same dryness allows the funky barnyard and nutty clove to cling to my mouth for an interminable amount of time! The yeast seems to want nothing more than to torment me; to drive me to another quaff to ease the funk and to refresh the flavors that are so complex when I exhale after the swallow.

Aroma really pinballs between scents and constantly morphs and changes through floral, fruit, and herbal shifts. Funk tags along as well. For the floral phase I perceive predominant scent of rosehips although I smell potpourri from time to time. For the fruit phase all things citrus are displayed with a cornucopia of scents ranging from grapefruit, orange, and lemon with some residual apricot lurking mostly in the background before slamming to the forefront with further warming. The herbal scents are more minty, but they seem to die down with further warming which was a bit of a letdown as that element lifted the aroma even higher in the early goings of consumption. Flavor holds the aforementioned apricot, sweet caramel, and a good dose of lightly stinging citric hops on the finish. The case could be made for these hops being spicy. Nice undertone of funk sounds out on the far finish, but the dryness isn\u2019t quite there yet. This bottle is only 7 months old, and maybe the brett hasn\u2019t yet had a chance to crisp this thing up, so it would be interesting to see how one of these ages. Mouthfeel is lightly syrupy which is an undesirable characteristic for this kind of beer, and perhaps with age, this beer will lose some weight. Carb\u2019s ok.

The apples, pear and peach which start are also accompanied initially by a biscuity flavor. Soon as the flavor advances however the yeast and spice show up bringing a yeast cake, banana, and classic yeast spice profile (clove and nutmeg) flavor to the tongue. In the end flavors of a more herbal and grapefruit citrus nature come to the tongue, leaving a sour and sweet (emphasis on the sweet) flavor to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer was on the slightly lighter side with the carbonation level being rather average.

Like an actual stone of amber, yet liquid. \r\nHead dissipates relatively quickly, although leaves few small clusters of light cream-colored retention in the center as well as all around the edge of the glass. \r\nMinimal Belgian lace, almost inexistent.  \r\nLight yeasty aroma.  Subtle hints of vegetable-esque aromas as well as spice. Salad greens; maybe kale, spinach. \r\nYeast aroma becomes more pronounced as ale warms up a bit. \r\nMild mouth feel, perhaps subtle crispiness, yet leaves a very slight dry aftertaste. \r\nYeast pronounced more in the taste than the aroma, nicely covers up portion of the hop taste. Much less hoppy than Ommegang\u2019s Belgian Pale Ale (BPA) \u2013 a positive attribute, in my opinion. \r\nSomewhat lacking in robustness of flavor; expected little more character. \r\nSlight alcohol at back of palate. \r\nTaste like it could be a session ale, although at 7% would probably advise against this.", "writed_at": "October 23, 2010"}, {"user_id": "skortila", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ub9c8\ud2f8\ub2e4", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Matilda", "review_score": 3.6, "review_content": "Bottled (2008).

Tangerines and tangelos protest as I take fingers to their skin, digging nails deep into their sticky resins rich with citric esters before breaking through into the sweet meats inside. The pith and skin adds bitterness in the back while the meats inside are ripe for suckling and savoring. Dried grass and flower petals lead into the Brett delights previously promised in her nose, and I revel in the soothing presence of sawdust and worn leather supple to the touch. As she sticks to my lips, tongue, and all inner surfaces of my mouth, I revel in her playful banter of fruity and dry, sweet and bitter, grassy and leathery, all culminating in gentle warmth.

The fish-recovers-ring legend, the princess starts a monastery, and so, we decided to buy this beer. Right. I\u2019m excited. But at home, right from the pour I\u2019m suspicious. \"Inspired\" by the ultra-pale Orval, we brewed an amber beer? Hmm. Well, amber it is, with modest off-white head. The first prominent aroma is...butter. Butter so thick that\u2019s all I smell for the first three or four sniffs. (No butter in Orval!) Further in, with effort, there is some grape jelly, cloves, cinnamon, and a hint of earthy hops. Flavor is pleasantly sweet caramel spice, green apples, soft lingering grapeskin finish. What I have here is far more dubbel than anything remotely related to Orval, but even more English strong ale than dubbel. (That would at least make sense of the butter and the distinctively sweet flavor.) Perhaps I read the label wrong, and wishful thinking got me into this state of confusion? I go back and check. Nope, it\u2019s definitely inspired by Orval.\r\n\r\nWell. I kind of like this, and I suppose I will rate it based on that, rather than my disappointment on the false billing.

The flavour is much like the aroma, lots of spices but not intense enough to make this a chore to drink. The fruit flavours, which resemble pears and orange rinds, give a balanced roundness to the spices. The finish has a light spiced bitterness, but is pretty smooth for the most part.

The head leaves some wispy lacing on the sides of my glass and never fully disappears.  The aroma is nicely funky with a typical barnyard note that is characteristic of Brett (butyric acid notes are quite noticeable); the funk reminds me of a mix of moldy leather, musty earth, phenolic soaked cotton-balls.  There is some acidity here in the nose as well that provides a tart backdrop along with some subtle, bread-driven malt notes.  There is some fruitiness here that is just noticed under the surface; it is mostly apple like, but the acidity seems to accents some lemon-like notes too.  As my nose gets used to the funk some hop character begins to be noticed; mostly grassy notes, but it has an herbal edge to it.  This is a very engaging, quite funky nose; quite enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nLightly sweet and it has a persistent carbonation that is not overly effervescent.  Fruit flavors of apple, pear and perhaps a touch of plum eventually yield to a sharp, Brett-driven funkiness that lingers on the mouth in the finish.  This is really hiding the oxidation well, this seems to be a characteristic of Brettanomyces beers, perhaps they scavenge all of the oxygen before it has a chance to degrade the malt character.  This still even has some hop character to it, though it is fairly soft with notes of light fresh-cut herbs, a touch of hay and a light persistent bitterness that is noticeable from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nToo quickly my 12oz serving of this beer is gone, I wish I had at least one more bottle so that I could continue to drink this brew.  Much more funky than when I had this originally in October of 2005.  This has developed into a really nice brew, though I wouldn\u2019t say that it has quite reached the level of Orval.  I am surprised how much fruitiness is still noticeable, it adds an interesting dimension, but I would probably prefer it a bit drier.  Really though this is a fantastic brew that I can find little fault with.\r\n\r\nSampled October, 2005\n\r\nOriginal Rating 3.7, 7/4/7/4/15\n\r\nPours a brilliantly clear copper color and is topped by a frothy, slightly rocky, pale tan colored head.  The aroma is funky and earthy: with notes of musty earth, lemon grass, a soft fruitiness reminiscent of apples pears &amp; citrus, and a hint of barnyard funk.  I was not expecting the Brett note (though it is of course in the beer they were inspired by), but it is still fairly subtle at this point.  The bottle does not look to be bottle conditioned, so I wonder if the Brett will continue to develop over time.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe taste has a certain fullness to it that is mouthcoating and slightly creamy in consistency.  The beer is lightly sweet as well, which up-plays the fruity citrus character that is here.  The hop character is not near as pronounced as I would have hoped for, but it is present with a bit of lingering bitterness in the finish and of course some spicy-citrusy hop notes up front.

The label remarks that this is somewhat of a tribute to a certain Belgian Beer and after the first one I realized how similar this is to Orval. Abundant earthy aroma, musty with some zesty citrus scents and lively sour malt. Smells fantastic, rich and aromatic. Grand pour producing a cloudy golden orange body with a huge fluffy white head. Thick lacing coats the glass, and there is some noticeable sediment at the bottom of my red wine glass. The head settles over time. Funky and lightly sour on the palate. A feel good bitterness rounds out the medium malt body. Flavor is still fresh and lively. Fermented musty fruits with nice flowery hops. A touch grassy and very yeasty.

As it warms, its similarity to truly Belgian beers creeps out (I wrote in my notes that it\u2019s like a glorious blend of Orval and Duvel).

I\u2019ll move the rating if I see one day a local creates a new entry for a Matilda Reserve\n\n\r\nIn short: A Saison-like crisp Belgian ale.\n\r\nHow: Tap at brewpub\n\r\nThe look: Clear golden blonde body with a small white head.\n\r\nIn long: Lots of crisp malts.  Although not funky per say the beer as a strong farmhouse character.  Fruity notes are on the lighter juicy citric side of things with grapefruits, granny smith apples and so on.  Wonderful complex hops finish blending Saaz-ish dry grassiness and citrusy American hops.  Citric tartness just make you wanna go for more and more.  This tap glass was much crisper and less candy than all the bottles I\u2019ve had before.

The biggest change from my previous rating was in the aroma; went from a 7 to a 10. Incredible nose with hops, Belgian candi sugar and hemp. Wow! Hazy amber with no visible carbonation. Very sophisticated appearance in the tulip glass in which it was served. Excellent, coating lace. Tastes as it smells, which is dunkel-weissy. Tastes more like a weiss beer than a Trappist. Certainly smooth. Has a hint of American hops in the finish. A good beer, but a little bit of a let down which confirms my original impression. Nevertheless, I gave it a 4.4. I think the issue is that compared to the other GI reserve series beers like BBC and the Imp IPA, it appears more pedestrian. 5/14/06: Draught at Beer on the Pier, Chicago. Sour aroma.

Nice orangey hop flavour that balances the malt nicely, well done.", "writed_at": "March 29, 2004"}, {"user_id": "JoeM500", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ub9c8\ud2f8\ub2e4", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Matilda", "review_score": 3.5, "review_content": "Hoppy nose is not exactly like the hoppy noses that I'm used to from Goose Island ales, it's more hay and grassy-like than the flowery soft citrus aromas that they are known for.

The aroma contained a nice balance of dry grain malt and hop bitterness.  The flavor was slightly sweet with apple, white grape, maybe a touch of sugar, and then a nice bitter hop balance in the finish.  This is probably better than the 1800 Demolition and well worth trying.", "writed_at": "May 1, 2003"}]
