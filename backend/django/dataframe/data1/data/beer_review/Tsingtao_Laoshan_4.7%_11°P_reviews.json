Okay; Hoppiness is low lemony grass nose, thin citrus and grass taste, and notable low bitterness for a clean finish; Slighty dry after taste, very easy to mouth.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: I had no expectation on this one, especially it was grabbed by chance from an 12-pack accidentally opened by store staff! So it comes as a surprise with a non-pungent smell, pretty clean taste, notable hop presence and a hassle-free finish. Fully quaffable for an Asian macro and good for washing down heavy meals.", "writed_at": "October 6, 2013"}]
