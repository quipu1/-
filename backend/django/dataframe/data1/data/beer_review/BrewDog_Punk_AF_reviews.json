Rather loosely structured, egg-white, 'broken', irregularly lacing but generally well-retaining head over a near clear, pale yellow-straw blonde beer with greenish tinge and some large bubbles rising up here and there.  Aroma of dried grapefruit peel, plaster, a bag of dusty old grain, unsweetened breakfast cereals, gypsum, dry straw, grass, stale urine, aspartame, old lemon zest, old jute cloth.  Spritzy onset, very minerally with lively carbonation but otherwise rather neutral like some mass-produced pale lager, dull grainy, even somewhat 'green' sweetishness and sourishness, supple and slim body, a tad glueish; remains rather thin, minerally and neutral in the middle, and the finish does not bring a whole lot of solace: if anything, the whole becomes even more glueish, but lacks in hop bitterness, with only a grassy, if admittedly medium-long effect.  There is a certain zestiness somewhere, but it lacks power and colour to save the day here - so that the entire thing comes across as a more bitter version of alcohol-free blonde lager.  This is it: BrewDog, after the exciting initial years of freestyling and producing one impressive brew after another - thereby proving to be one of the great initial motors of American style craft brewing in old Europe - has changed into a factory producing mass-scale supermarket beers...  This is probably putting things a bit too crude, as they still come up with interesting (small-batch) beers every now and then, but this particular one is especially underwhelming when one considers the great things BrewDog has achieved in the past (I have been following them from almost the beginning and have even met the founders when they were just taking their first steps outside of the United Kingdom).  I understand that you want to make an alcohol-free IPA as this is a commercially interesting concept nowadays, but with all the history and experience behind it, I was expecting BrewDog to perform better at this task than most others - and then I meet this beer and, in trying to be as objective as possible, have to establish that even some less experienced craft brewers in the Low Countries have produced better alcohol-free beers in the past years.  Granted, a supermarket shelf will never be the ideal 'habitat' for any beer, but I was at least expecting this one to be packed with aromatically colourful hops, just like it alcoholic progenitor.  Then again, I haven't had any Punk IPA in many years now, so who knows if it is still as hoppy and aromatic as it used to be...
