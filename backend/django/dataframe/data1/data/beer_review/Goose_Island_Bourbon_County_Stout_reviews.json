Oz. Bottle.\n\nI have tried the last 3 years of vintage (2017, 2018, and 2019) and have rated each vintage separately as I tried them.  Although, with the exception of a few tasting notes and the alcohol content, I can't say that there has been much difference between the vintages.  This is (and apparently always will be) a big, boozy, beer that is extremely sweet.  I enjoy it immensely, but I do find that the syrupy sweetness becomes a little overpowering by the time I am finishing the beer.  Basically, it is liquid candy for adults!!\n\n2019 Vintage (18AUG24) - 14.7% abv\nAROMA (9):   Big, boozy notes of soy sauce, vanilla, and alcohol with some slight smoke undertones.\n\nAPPEARANCE (4): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly.  Granted, I am drinking this almost 2 years after the bottled date, but given that the label says that it develops in the bottle up to 5 years, I would expect more body and life from the head.  Lacing is almost non-existent too.\n\nTASTE (7): Very sweet with huge flavors of dark fruit (e.g. raisins) and caramel, with just a hint of vanilla and smoke on the back end.\n\nMOUTHFEEL (4): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture.  Carbonation is average and the finish is medium and sweet.\n\nOVERALL (18): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes.  Even though the alcohol content is less, I am really not detecting any difference between this and the 2018 vintage.  I would prefer it if this one were less sweet and had more smokiness.  Or at least something to offset all that sweetness.\n\n\n2018 Vintage (17SEP18) - 15.2% abv\nAROMA (9):   Big notes of soy sauce, vanilla, and alcohol with some slight smoke undertones.\n\nAPPEARANCE (4): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly.\n\nTASTE (7): Very sweet with flavors of dark fruit (e.g. raisins) and caramel, with just a hint of smoke on the back end.\n\nMOUTHFEEL (4): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture.  Carbonation is average and the finish is medium and sweet.\n\nOVERALL (18): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes.  Compared to the 2017 vintage, this one seems to have even less smoky flavor, and the 2017 didn't have much to begin with.  I would prefer it if this one were less sweet and had more smokiness.\n\n\n2017 Vintage (04AUG17).\nAROMA (9):   Big notes of soy sauce, caramelized brown sugar, alcohol, and dark fruits (e.g. raisins).\n\nAPPEARANCE (4): Pours an opaque black with a weak, dark tan, head that dissipates quickly.\n\nTASTE (7): Very sweet with flavors of dark fruit and caramel, with just a hint of smoke on the back end.\n\nPALATE (4): Thick bodied with a creamy smooth texture.  Carbonation is average and the finish is short and sweet.\n\nOVERALL (18): I really like this beer but it is almost too sweet for my tastes.  I would prefer it if it were a little less sweet and had just a pinch more smokiness.  But all in all, a fantastic beer.

This one was actually made to a recipe of which the brewer thought it fitted the added bourbon taste best - let this serve as an example to all the breweries nowadays which believe putting a stout in a liquor barrel automatically leads to a world-class masterpiece... Very dark burgundy colour, blackish but revealing its colour around the edges, with the expected thick yellow \u2019film\u2019 stuck to the glass as it progresses; quite some fizz for this style, visible on the edges.  These tiny bubbles try to sustain a thin, loose, deep beige head, but cannot prevent it from receding quickly and even all but disappear in the end under the heavy alcohol dosage. Truly mouth-watering aroma, very strong and perfumey and reaching my nose instants after opening the bottle: cold black coffee but in a good, very aromatic way here, bitter chocolate, lots of vanilla-like tannins of extreme elegance, wet wood and obviously some bourbon, moist Cuban cigar, milk chocolate, kahlua, old dry sherry, subtle hints of bayleaf, banana liqueur, liquorice, rhum-soaked raisins, roasted meat and cinnamon, varnish and shoe polish as can be expected from such a strong beer but in an aroma this complex, I cannot see any reason to be bothered by this; if anything, it only adds further complexity. I am flabbergastered: it contains all the good things of a barrel-aged stout, looking for flaws is pointless and even insulting to a beer of this stature, and everything is in absolutely perfect balance - nothing pushes itself forward, nothing clashes with anything else. This is among the most wonderful beer aromas I ever had the honour to smell. The taste is equally amazing: a tangy candied sweetness as expected, setting up a line of communication with the finish, but still restrainedly so; a deep basic grain sourishness, a very fine and concentrated sparkle on the tongue from carbonation, a slight umami accent but remaining in the background where it belongs, a massive body but still elegant and lean in spite of the far-above-average ABV... Deep bitter chocolate malts, absolutely delicious, thick and oily mouthfeel and just the right dosis of coffee-like roasted bitterness in the end, blending in perfectly with the rest instead of manifesting itself too much. All the way in the finish, it becomes even more complex, as a noble \u2019woodiness\u2019 sets in, drying tannins, a lovely peppery hop bitter accent which balances out the sweetness to the point of perfection, and a warming glow of liqueurish and very clearly bourbon-like alcohol accompanying the liquid down the throat without ever becoming burning or astringent, though its presence is hard to ignore. I had rarer examples of American barrel-aged stouts than this, with all their respective hypes surrounding them, but no matter how great they are, there is always one little detail which prevents them from being completely perfect: just a tad too much of the bourbon or alcohol, just a tad too cloying, just lacking a tad of roasted bitterness... But this one, the grandfather of them all, manages to avoid all that.  This is a truly divine brew - if there is a heaven, and I think there is not so I\u2019m drinking these beers here, I\u2019m sure this will be served there... I am infinitely glad I got the chance to taste this work of art. A great example, not just for its style, not just for beer in general, but for gastronomy in general. Kudos to Goose Island - the fact that it has been taken over by AB InBev worries me a bit, but apparently this 2014 vintage is as good as it could have been, so I assume the InBev bankers are not interfering with production here. Completely amazing and even better than I expected.  Update: I have also tasted last year\u2019s batch in the meantime and it showed this souring infection that has caught so much attention - clearly not a flattering feature, but far less dramatic than I expected.

The head fades almost instantly leaving a trace level of lace on the sides of the glass. Upon swirling the brew in the glass, its thickness could be seen, with fingers of the beer clinging to the sides of the glass and slowly receding to the bottom of the glass to its resting place.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The aroma of the beer is massive of sweet smells with caramel, molasses, dark fruits of raisin, plum and cherry, as well as a little bit of vanilla all there. Along with these smells are lots of darker aromas of chocolate and roasted malt smells as well as some other lighter aromas of coffee. Rounding out all these smells, and as the name would suggest, a huge bourbon smell as well as a nice woody aroma mix with the rest of the smells, producing a delicious, very dark, sweet and warming aroma overall. \r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins with a big roasted malt flavor along with sweeter flavors of molasses and darker fruits of raisin and prune. Right from the start, there is also a big bourbon flavor. The bourbon flavor is big and smooth tasting with lots of oaky and woody flavors mixed within. The bourbon gets even richer as the taste advances, bringing with it just a hint of bitterness as more woodsy flavors and a bit of coffee come to the tongue. Along with these increases in the boozy tastes, other sweeter flavors of vanilla and a bit of chocolate come to the tongue more toward the end complementing the other flavors nicely. In the end, with all the nice roasted, sweet, and bourbon flavors of the brew, a very pleasant and still very smooth, yet somehow very warming taste is left to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is super thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The thick and creamy body are most fantastic for the darker and heavy boozy and sweet flavors of the brew, with the lower carbonation only enhancing these flavors even more. With the lower carbonation and super thick body, all the fantastic flavors really get to sit and coat the mouth allowing the taste buds to be bathed in all the delicious flavors and soothing the mouth with a fantastic feel.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013This is a super flavorful, yet massively smooth and balanced stout with an amazing blend of bourbon, sweet, and roast flavor.

Some sweetness in the middle ground....light vanilla, oak, molasses. But, the bourbon is still very much the centerpiece of the finish. It still dominates over any other subtleties this beer may offer....I can almost taste the delicacy in the base, but the bourbon just overwhelms my taste buds and palate.

For beer, barrel-aging is generally not necessary and in my opinion it often does more harm than good.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor this beer, they brewed a very strong, flavorful stout, with an ABV that is very high for beer, but of course still very low compared to spirits. Thankfully, it stands up to the barrel-aging pretty well.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of flavor, there is some smoke and wood flavor here, but it also has an almost overwhelming level of malty sweetness, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, and creme brule. Burnt and roasted malts are there as well, although the classic stout flavors are pretty much drown out by everything else. At 60 IBU\u2019s, there are not enough hops to adequately balance out all of the extremely strong, sweet, malty flavors.\n\r\n\n\r\nI had this at a tasting - maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I could spend a few hours drinking one bottle, to savor it a bit more slowly.

Appearance is nearly always the same, huge, black body with a timid tan foam that never seems to last for more than a few moments.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2014 / tap / fresh] The bourbon on this one is exceptionally smooth out of the gate. HUGE chocolate fudge &amp; brownie character with a nice amount of vanillin &amp; barrel. Smooth, delicious. Probably one of the \"easiest\" drinking fresh BCS\u2019s I\u2019ve had.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2013 / tap / fresh] Tons of bourbon on the nose, along with lots &amp; lots of chocolate. Incredibly smooth, even with the heavy bourbon notes; very warming &amp; full bodied. Mild roasty finish, light char &amp; bitterness in the aftertaste. Nice vanilla character picks up with time. Lovely oak &amp; bourbon throughout.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2012 / bottle / fresh] Big-time oak &amp; vanilla aroma on this one; the booze takes on more of a raw whiskey character. Bittersweet chocolate, lots of syrupy goodness with a mild roast in the finish. Oak, whiskey, &amp; chocolate aftertaste, mild brown sugar.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2012 / tap / 1 year old] Has mellowed out with a year, but the bourbon character is still nice &amp; robust. Picked up a much bigger dark fruit (currant &amp; date) character this time around, with a very deep &amp; roasted malt aftertaste.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2011 / tap / 2 years old] More subdued aroma than any other vintage, but very well composed. Bigger roasted char-like bite with a very smooth bourbon character. Nice chocolate fudge finish with some bitter roast &amp; cocoa in the aftertaste. \n\n\r\n\r\n[2009 / bottle / 4 years old] Thanks, Mike! 12 oz bottle. Amazing chocolate aroma &amp; flavor with lovely notes of currant &amp; brown sugar covered black cherries. Bourbon is insanely smooth, lots of chocolate in the finish with a little bit of finishing oak &amp; vanilla. This was simply fantastic, probably the best vintage/age, along with a couple of the 2008 bottles I\u2019ve had.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2008 / bottle / 4.5 years old] Thanks, Jeff! Even with this age, the bourbon character is very robust but so, so incredibly smooth, it is unreal. This vintage/age showed the largest molasses, vanilla, &amp; brown sugar characters of them all. Big chocolate in the finish, too, with lighter inclusions of oak. Tied for my favorite vintage/age of BCS, along with the 4 year old 2009 bottle.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2008 / bottle / 5 years old] thanks again, Jeff. Very, very slight oxidation. But this is still a beast... Caramel covered chocolate bourbon fudge cake. Like a dessert with bourbon. Caramelized sugar finish, some vanilla, sherry. The last bottle was slightly better, but this was still great. I think the sweet spot for BCS is around 4 years.\n\n\r\n\r\n[2007 / bottle / 6.5 years old] Thanks, Jeff! Carbonation is mostly gone, but that doesn\u2019t stop this from being a badass stout, even at nearly 7 years out. Surprisingly, this was less oxidized than a few, younger bottles of 2008 that I\u2019d had. Still a largely complex aroma of dark fudge, tangy dark fruit, very mild soy, oak, subtle molasses, brown sugar, &amp; vanilla.

There is some vanilla, roast malt, and a slight chocolate as well as coffee, but it is definitely minimal compared to the liquor aroma.\r\n\r\nT- Up front there is more bourbon, vanilla, and some chocolate. As I swallow, there are some fruit esters, predominantly cherry with some fig, as well as a ton of alcohol. The finish is quite long, and the bitterness becomes present to help balance out the syrupy sweetness of the malts and bourbon. \r\n\r\nM- This is a thick and viscous beer, almost syrup in consistency.

It was bottled on 11/12/09. I\u2019m not sure how much it cost at the time it was bought.\r\n\n\n\r\nAppearance: Opaque ink black all around. Perhaps some dark maroon highlights on the edge, but definitely one of the darker beers you\u2019ll see. Initially forms a small coating of brown foam, but it fizzles away quickly and leaves no lacing.\r\n\n\n\r\nSmell: Highly aromatic as it can be smelled from an arm\u2019s length away. Massive black licorice, dark cherry and bourbon notes.\r\n\n\n\r\nTaste: Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout is a monster of a beer. Even after three and a half years of aging, this vintage still packs a punch. Massive sweetness in the first half followed by overt boozy character on the second half. Black licorice, chocolate syrup, black cherry, vanilla and a hint of plum or grape can all be detected throughout the palette (in that order). To call it sweet would be an understatement, but to call it sickly or cloying would be a lie. \r\n\n\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so impressive about this beer is the fact it\u2019s so well-balanced. While there isn\u2019t hop character per se as far as citrus, pine, flowers, etc., there definitely is a prominent bitterness to this palette. This makes the beer drink like the imperial stout it is rather than any kind of borderline spirit other \"extreme\" beers tend to be like. The bourbon character is quite pronounced as well, leaving a slightly woody aftertaste along with hints of scorched sugar or vanilla. Sure there\u2019s a raw alcohol component as well, but it complements the taste so well I can\u2019t imagine this beer without it.\r\n\n\n\r\nDrinkability: This is not exactly the type of beer you drink on a whim. At 13% ABV, and a high price tag, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout is a special brew. That being said, savoring the experience is the drinker\u2019s responsibility. It\u2019s not simply syrup plus alcohol, it\u2019s a genuine stout body. Thick and viscous in the mouth for sure, but not sticky or chewy sensation. I\u2019d describe the finish as clean if it weren\u2019t for the alcohol drying out my tongue.

However, there\u2019s hardly any head. Any vestiges of a tan-colored head fade quickly and leave almost no lacing. Really, we\u2019ve got to start talking about alcohol legs when we get to this gravity. And they\u2019re pretty impressive.\r\n\r\nS: Tons of bourbon, augmented by dark fruits and vanilla. Not much in the way of roasted malts; it pretty much hits on the sweeter aspects of a good imperial stout, rather than the more savory ones. It\u2019s really not that boozy for 15%, either. Not the strongest aroma ever (due to the low carbonation), but incredibly evocative.\r\n\r\nT: Sweet? Yes. Boozy? Yes. The flavor I notice first are stewed plums, raisins, and figs - this has a hell of a dark fruit note to it. Ultimately, it will finish with its trademark bourbon character and vanilla-infused chocolate. A slight note of smokiness will appear after a while. It\u2019s warm, yes, but given its gravity, the booze could be a lot worse. Basically, it has the hallmark character of a proper boozy beer - an alcohol character that blends with the flavor profile instead of clashing. This definitely bears a passing resemblance to FW Parabola, only with a lot more in the way of finesse and balance. The only thing missing is some complexity; thankfully, what\u2019s there is very enjoyable to savor slowly.\r\n\r\nM: The finish is ultra syrupy, wet, and sweet. Very creamy in its palate texture, aided by the subtle (at best) carbonation. Some oak tannins come out in the late aftertaste in an attempt to dry the palate a little, but to no avail. This really is the type of beer that sits indolently on the tongue with massive, thick sweetness. You will NOT drink this quickly, so don\u2019t even dare - just veg over it for an hour or two and everything will be peachy keen.\r\n\r\nO: Well, what more can be said? It\u2019s a big monster, but with enough deftness and sophistication to help give it a little extra \u2019something\u2019.

Just as I remembered it.   Aroma is thick, syrupy, complex, nuanced, etc.  It takes a while for the first sip, partially because the aroma is so good, and partially because it\u2019s so imposing.  Taste is aggressive.  It\u2019s a little raw from being so new, but you can tell this will age well.  Buried deep within the aroma is coffee and roasted malts, but it\u2019s smothered with a thick layer of syrupy bourbon.  Packs a punch in every aspect, and it\u2019s so smooth despite its increasingly insane alcohol content.  Hoping to grab at least one more 4 pack and let these age.\r\n\n\n\r\nThis was much better than last time.  Not sure how much was the age (5.5 months), and how much was my improved taste.  I bet it\u2019s mostly the age.  The flavors are still bold, but are now all within the realm of tolerance.  Pours a jet black with brown head that\u2019s aggressively fizzy and fades quickly.  Aroma is sweet molasses, bourbon, smoked wood, chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol.  Taste is sticky sweet creamy chocolate, building fast to a huge wave of bourbon and earthy, woody roasted malts, then hollowing out in the finish to a great aftertaste.  The age has made this go down much easier, and the ABV is a little less prominent.  I\u2019d like to age it longer, but it\u2019s too hard to resist.  10+4+9+4+17=4.4\r\n\n\n\r\nPeople apparently love this beer.  I must not be experienced enough to appreciate it, or something.  I\u2019m not well-versed in bourbon or any other hard liquors, and haven\u2019t acquired the taste required to enjoy it. Pours dark brown, very dark with some red on the edges.  A tan, short-lived head.  Aroma packs a punch - super sweet molasses, vanilla, and tons of alcohol.  Taste is enormous - it requires effort to drink it.  Definitely a drink to sip slowly and (try to) enjoy.  So unlike any beer I\u2019ve had.  Absent the label, I wouldn\u2019t have even guessed this was a stout, or even beer in general.  Overwhelmingly sweet, syrupy taste up front, a small glimpse of complexity in the middle, but then right into a tidal wave of bourbon and alcohol heat.  Insane 15% ABV is obvious, for better or worse, in every aspect of the beer.  Good for up to 5 years in the bottle, and this was only 30 days old... so I\u2019ll let the rest of the 4-pack age for a while and see how that affects the experience.  7+4+4+4+11 = 3", "writed_at": "December 3, 2013"}, {"user_id": "RoyalTenenbaum", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ubc84\ubcf8 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub9ac \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc6b0\ud2b8", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Bourbon County Stout", "review_score": 4.5, "review_content": "Incredible nose of cherry, vanilla and bourbon.

Re-rate 3/6/13 - Doing a side-by-side tasting of a 2008 bottle with a 2012 bottle with John.  2008 bottle from trade with Crajun, Thanks!  2008 bottle pours pitch black with no head.  Aroma is one of the best I\u2019ve smelled.  Bourbon is much more subtle in the 2008 than the 2012.  Getting tons of tobacco and chocolate in the 2008 which I absolutely love.  Taste also has an amazing balance of tobacco, chocolate, and bourbon.  Mouthfeel on the 2008 is almost perfect too, would like just a touch more carbonation but it\u2019s silky smooth, sticky, thick and chewy.  Having this aged version has really changed my opinion of this beer.  One of the best I\u2019ve had now.  I will definitely lay down the rest of my 2012\u2019s in the hopes that the difference in taste is just from aging and not a recipe change.  My new rating of this beer is based on the 2008 version.

Re-rate 12/12/14 - Love the 2014 bottle fresh.  Just drank it side by side with 12 &amp; 13 and I was surprised I like the 2014 best.

This is an ode to the style, a culmination of science and passion and personality, packed into individual bottles. Opening the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout \u201908 is like opening a bottle of pure, distilled artisanal craftsmanship. This is bottled joy, and I feel totally undeserving in having my grasping share in it, but since it somehow slipped out of its bottle and into a glass, I guess I can\u2019t let it go to waste. The body is deep black, but shows a light brown underbelly on the edges of my \u201cbeer chalice.\u201d The aroma lunges from the glass, controlled but powerful, and at once vegetal, deep, and spicy. Smells of cobwebs, old wood, clove, all-spice, pomegranate and a high and dry bitter edge seduce me closer to the glass. The aroma is more powerful here, and under the control of the brew I take a light sip - a medium-heavy body greets my palate, and bubbles tickle the roof my mouth. Unctuous flavors of licorice and molasses crawl out of the beer, balanced by deep, dark chocolatey malts, and militating against a heavy oak quality and a strong-armed alcoholic burn. This is a glass bristling with intensity, where all the forces, titanic behemoths, are perfectly poised and balanced against each other, quivering with strength, but none of them ever gets the upper hand to upset this beer\u2019s adroit flavor profile.

First reviewed 12/19/2008.\r\n\r\nHad to have two of these before I felt comfortable reviewing it. \r\nPoured from a bottle into a goblet.\r\n\r\nIt is amazing how thick this stout actually pours - a chocolate brown, nearly black. A dark caramel color appears around the edges of the glass, but there is no chance any light is going to make it through. \r\n\r\nQuite a smoky smell overlaying the other aromas: chocolate, molasses, and some soft vanilla. Overpowering. \r\n\r\nThe power bourbon county stout employs is phenomenal. The smokiness is the overlying characteristic of the entire sip, but flavors abound. The chocolate my nose devoured is slightly less apparent in the taste, but strong caramel, some light coffee, and vanilla flavors are all present. The toasted malt is stronger than any other flavors for the first few seconds. Finally, the bourbon comes through, with a strong alcohol taste. The 13% ABV definitely makes itself known, and it burns a little as it slides down my throat. The strong smokey flavor ensures that I finish my sip out on a toasted, almost burnt malty note. Incredibly intense.\r\n\r\nAs thick as a milkshake, it has a creamy feel with low carbonation. This stout is so thick it actually takes a few seconds to melt in my mouth. \r\n\r\nThis is defniitely one to sip on. The brewers don\u2019t know of a cigar that can hold up to the bourbon county stout, and I could not pick anything, much less a cigar, that does. Everything fades in its presence...\r\n\r\nI have not encountered a beer with such an intense flavor. I took almost 2 hours to drink the first one, and the second one was not much quicker. Impossible to session, but extremely enjoyable as a single glass. It is very difficult to rate this beer, as it is very different than other beers I have tasted.

It definitely has the same aftertaste of Maker\u2019s. Medium bodied with a oily yet creamy texture. Has a long bittersweet finish. Overall, this beer is awesome. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve found a beer than reminds me of my favorite whiskey.

Reviewed on 08-08-2011, making it almost two years old. 13% abv. Poured into an over sized wine glass.\r\n\r\nA - Perfectly black body. Even holding it up to the light I don\u2019t get any brown or red hints, just black. Really dark mocha head that doesn\u2019t stick around for very long. The lacing and retention is pretty awesome. A swirl of the glass produces more mocha foam that almost has a red tint. Theres even legs too! Just looks perfect. 5.0/5\r\n\r\nS - Bourbon initially. High quality bourbon. Then oak, vanilla, cocoa powder, and lots of roasty malty goodness. The finish is certainly alcoholic. 4.5/5\r\n\r\nT - Crazy smooth. I taste bourbon, oak, rich vanilla, and some coffee and chocolate notes. Just a hint of bitter roasted malts. The finish is alcoholic and warming. It does come off a bit strong, but in a good way. Its not even that complex of a beer. Its just extremely well put together, Every flavor flows together perfectly. Nothing really stands out or steals the show. Really fantastic taste. 5.0/5\r\n\r\nM - Velvety smooth and super thick. Its coats your tongue and doesn\u2019t go away until the last nuance of vanilla and bourbon fades away. Being so creamy and having fairly low carbonation, its a sipper. 4.5/5\r\n\r\nO - This is one of my favorite stouts. The bourbon barrel notes really compliment the base beer. Its just so smooth and rich with tons of amazing flavors. If the AB-Inbev buy out means a higher supply of this stuff, then I\u2019m game. 4.5/5\r\n\r\n2011 Vintage, bottled on, 11/11/2011, #1711. Reviewed on 05-15-2012, making it roughly 6 months old. 14.5% abv. Poured into a brandy snifter. \r\n\r\nA - Pitch black body. Dark mocha one finger high head. Settles down to a thin cap and thick edging. Some light lacing but a swirl leaves behind a ridiculous amount of alcoholic legs and regenerates the head. A thin layer of alcohol just stays on the side of the glass for eternity. Perfect. 5.0/5\r\n\r\nS - Heavy bourbon notes. Dark caramelized fruits, molasses, oak, maple, caramel, butterscotch and loads of sweet vanilla. This leads into some bitter cocoa powder and coffee beans. There is a nice alcoholic burn on the finish. 5.0/5\r\n\r\nT - Starts off with hot bourbon notes. Roasty and lightly bitter cocoa powder with vanilla and caramel sweetness. Some faint notes of dark fruits, coconut, and maple. The finish is long and bitter. Alcohol is prevalent but well integrated. 4.5/5\r\n\r\nM - Quite boozy, so much so that the thick syrupy mouth feel seems to become watery towards the finish. Really coats your mouth though. 4.5/5\r\n\r\nO - For a six month old beer this is drinking really damn well. I think I prefer it with a year or two on it though. The flavors seem to meld together a bit more which helps with the intense boozy bourbon notes. The \u201909 having only 13% abv also helps its cause a bit. 4.5/5", "writed_at": "May 16, 2012"}, {"user_id": "sherm1016", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ubc84\ubcf8 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub9ac \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc6b0\ud2b8", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Bourbon County Stout", "review_score": 4.5, "review_content": "12oz bottle, 2008 vintage.

Heavy hits of pure espresso dark roast bitterness hit all over on the backend of the swallow. as it warmed that same delicious Butterschotch flavor that i smelled started popping out, much more sweetness up front and bringing that bitter dark chocolate espresso to the back with little hints of raisin here and there.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel:\r\nSuprisingly it was thinner then I thought it would be. definately not thick or chewy. more oily and slick. the warmer it got the more sticky sweetness it left on the lips.\r\n\r\nDrinkability: Because of how boozy it was I didn\u2019t think i would want to drink a lot of this, the flavors are so heavy and rich that i didn\u2019t think i would want to drink a lot.

Just a thin, 1/3 cm film on the edge of the glass, like a contact lens on an eye. \r\n\r\nSmell is bourbon, vanilla, then some dark, sweet-smelling malts. Really can smell (burnt) caramel. This smells exceptional. Liquid caramel on the tongue. Wow. The bourbon is devastating. Great balance in the flavor profile. Perhaps the most complex American imperial stout I have had: chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, oak, vanilla, bourbon. Malts abound. Almost cloyingly sweet.\r\n\r\nThis feels great. Silky body that demands sipping. Thick and chewy. Probably, as the bottle suggests, would go well with a cigar. Not much on cigars myself, but I can only imagine. Low carbonation which translates into a sticky residual feeling in the mouth. Very nice.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure what to say about drinkability. Yes, pick this one up if you can. But I can\u2019t imagine having more than one of these in a night. I can barely sip it given its heaviness, boldness, and complexity. This is the bourbon stout to try.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n2008 vintage.

Some roasted barley, but nothing overly bitter or really roasted. Strong dark chocolate with a good amount of fudge like flavor. Definitely has an oaky and vanilla flavor, but no real smokiness.

It\u2019s there the second the cap lifts from the bottle and from the first it\u2019s overwhelming.  The bourbon and oak are undeniable, as are the notes of vanilla and port.  Then come hefty butterscotch and liquorice chords which are raised on the backs of the bitterest coffee and the oldest, woodiest hops.  The 13% ABV only serves to impress the whiskey connection and makes this the most spirit like beer I\u2019ve had.  But the booze isn\u2019t the only thing to take one\u2019s breath away.  The flavours are endlessly deep.  The vanilla comes on strong but peels back to reveal chocolate and ash, tobacco and leather; but there are subtleties to be found.  Aniseed and lemon grass are noted at the back of the palate, as are cherries and raisins.  There is too a certain soy sauce flavour reminiscent of the bolder Mikkeller beers.

I\u2019ve had this before and I know it\u2019s hard to get head development going. So I tried a rather aggressive pour into my snifter, but all I got was a minimal layer of dark beige foam that dissipates immediately into a minimal ring of lacings.\r\n\r\nThe smell is amazing. Massive bourbon aromas sit side by side with a wonderful smooth stout base. Vanilla, almonds, oak, licorice and a hint of soy sauce. Some hints of brown sugar and molasses. The roasted malts really need to struggle to keep up with the bourbon, but I think they manage quite well. The bourbon gets a little boozy and I pick up plenty of alcohol fumes.\r\n\r\nThe taste follows suit and surly doesn\u2019t disappoint, even though expectations get cranked up by the appearance and smell. The bourbon flavors are really powerful, rich and full, but nonetheless the beer manages to stay balanced. Lots of vanilla and oak with notes of almonds. Hints of sweet licorice. Perhaps a suggestion of soy sauce. The roasted malty character is noticeable but it gets a little hard to detect with all the bourbon notes going on. Nevertheless, the malts manage to create a good balancing point for the powerful bourbon flavors. All in all, the beer has a pleasant balance between sweetness and a salty note. The usual flavors of dark fruits and chocolate are really hard to pick up in this one, but I do think here is a delightful note of truffles. The finish is loaded with boozy and hot alcohol that fits nicely with the sweetness from the bourbon and malts, but it gets a little too much here and there. Wood, notes of salt licorice, a light herbal bitterness and long-lasting bourbon notes round everything up.\r\n\r\nVery very viscous and smooth - this one is thick like cream. Medium, well suited carbonation. Although both smell and taste is great in this one, the mouthfeel is really the highlight here, it\u2019s just that great. It just delivers a sophisticated expression to an otherwise bold and cocky beer.\r\n\r\nThis is a good imperial stout, to say the least. Very powerful with a massive bourbon character. It\u2019s quite impressive that it still manages to come of as balanced. However, it\u2019s not perfect. Although this is obviously a sipper, the alcohol gets to demanding and overpowering every now and then. And due to the onslaught of the bourbon flavors, the beer looses some complexity.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This bottle was about 11 months old. I\u2019ve sampled a bottle from the same batch when it was reasonably fresh, and although I think it holds up really well with plenty of bourbon still hanging around, I think the bourbon notes have faded just a little bit.\r\n\r\nServing type: bottle\r\n\r\n(Copy of old Beer Advocate review)", "writed_at": "November 4, 2009"}, {"user_id": "MrPickles", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ubc84\ubcf8 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub9ac \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc6b0\ud2b8", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Bourbon County Stout", "review_score": 4.1, "review_content": "7oz Tap at Stub and Herb\u2019s.

Nose hits you right out of the bottle with sweet and charred notes.

Flavor is amazing; sweet, rich, dessert-like,  and robust, still a bit young.  Notes of black strap molasses, lots of candied currants, burnt caramel, sweet vanilla bean, and chocolate chip cookies start the flavor progression but they are immediately followed by lots charred/scorched oak, light anise, a hefty amount of bourbon warmth, light notes of dark roast coffee, and some floral hops moving into the finish.  Palate is too carbonated being lively but the full body and the velvety, chewy, nearly oily texture made up for it a bit; more than moderate warmth.  Finishes only average length with sweet notes diminishing leaving bourbon, some roast, and light floral hop notes.  Lots of mixed emotions in this one; a perfect flavor with so many nice, complementing things going on.  However, the forced carbonation hurt the head and the palate, which could have great, the finish died out a bit too quickly, the warmth was nice for a bourbon imperial stout but was a bit too young, and the nose could have been great with a bit more time in the cellar.

It was so thick that when trying to pour it from extreme heights to stir up a head, nothing came because it was so soft and dense, and merely absorbed the falling liquid like a trampoline. (4 on appearance b/c I like a big dark head on my impys).  Flavor - holy shit!  Tons of everything good from chocolate, vanilla, smoke, currants, molasses, bourbon, and port.  The alcohol bites pretty hard, but in a very bourbonesque way that warms the stomach very well - I love it.  The thickest and most coating brew to have ever touched my palate - drinking this is like eating a 4 course meal.  Overall - this thing is fucking phenomenal and I must rush to get the last one that was on the self at whole foods to age even further.  With more age to soften the flavor and aroma this will be a 4.9 (I\u2019ll still deduct 1 for the lack of head).

The bourbon definitely makes itself known, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s overpowering. Once it warms up, the bourbon comes out even more in the aroma.

There\u2019s still dark dark malts to be had, but they come out more in the taste and finish. Speaking of the taste: bourbon hits you up front, but it settles down into dark bitter &amp; roasted malts and some coffee, and even less chocolate. There\u2019s some semi-sweet malt flavors that help balance out the dark bitterness. Bourbon comes out more in the beginning of the finish. Burns the throat more as it warms. Finishes like a dream. Nice and bitter malty, with some  overlying sweetness again, but the emphasis is on the roasty &amp; bitter.

The thick, syrupy, opaque mahogany liquid exudes fumy notes of vanilla and burnt caramel over the silky dark chocolate malts and omnipresent bourbon.  The aroma is nothing short of fantastic, and it transitions perfectly into the luxurious, intense flavor.  Dark chocolate and caramel caress the tongue, while the intense bourbon melts perfectly into the fold.  There is a perfectly complimentary smoky taste that sticks to the roof of the mouth and the edges of the tongue.  This brew is masterfully crafted in its use of massive amounts of malt to balance out the huge bourbon notes.  I can\u2019t believe how well this has held up after nearly three years.  My only knock is on appearance, which would certainly garner a perfect score save for the lack of a head or lacing, a condition that is most likely due to the brew\u2019s age.

The taste is really frenzied and complex. Fruit notes are mild and almost lost in the presence of the alcohol. Finishes lightly acidic, lightly bitter and very roasty, chocolate notes lingering. Alcoholic warmth is substantial. The mouthfeel is very creamy, lightly carbonated and lightly tannic. Full bodied would be a gross understatement.

The mouthfeel is soft and full bodied, quite impressive for this age; the sweetness sticks on the lips; good chocolate and alcohol.\nHolding up very well, not too much oxidisation, rounder and better amalgamated than the 2013.\n\n2016-12-28, vintage 2015, courtesy of Brian, 8-4-9-4-17=42\nThe aroma is loaded with phenol. Rich flavor; enough chocolate, but also too much phenol, definitively there is bourbon; too much alcohol burn too.

The aroma is fading; there is some roasted malt, tar, Parmigiano Reggiano; nice but with the first signs of oxidization. Full bodied beer, with round and thick mouthfeel; the mix of roasted malt and dark chocolate flavor is excellent; fairly sweet, also because the bitterness is fading away; there is some demerara sugar, leather, wood, a touch of Bourbon, a hint of liquorice, a bit salty indeed.\nIt\u2019s a very interesting sipper.\n\n2012-12-18, vintage 2008, 4 years old, 13% ABV, 9-4-9-5-18=45\nbottled 10/28/08\nIt pours a black color, oily, with almost no head. Impressive aroma of firewood and Bourbon, with a peppery finish, and very light phenol. Full bodied, the texture is a bit oily; it has a very rich flavor of dark chocolate, medium sweet, with later hints of coffee and leather; some vanilla as well; the barrel aging adds complexity and alcohol warmth.\nWonderful now; it may not be suitable for longer aging, some oxidization would not fit here.\n\n2011-07-14, vintage 2008, 3 years old, 13% ABV, 8-4-8-4-17=41\nBlack color; it has not much carbonation, it pours thick and oily, with a small and not persistent brown head. Aroma of roasted malt and dark chocolate first, some vanilla, leather, alcohol, cardboard and light phenol. The body is very strong, with a rather oily mouthfeel; very good dark chocolate flavor, then roasted malt, some tar and liquorice, finally the pleasant Bourbon component; moderate residual sweetness; strong warming feeling from the alcohol; correct bitterness.\nExtremely powerful.\n\n2009-11-12, at Monk's Caf\u00e9, Stockholm, vintage 2007, 2 years old, 13% ABV, 9-4-8-4-17=42\nBlack color; it's almost flat, with no carbonation, no head. The aroma shows a good mix of Bourbon vanilla, whiskey, roasted malt, paper, cardboard, very light smoke. It has a good body strength; strong chocolate flavor, burning alcohol feeling; well rich; dark caramel, light vanilla, light smoke.\n\n2007-05-23, vintage 2006, 1 year old, 11% ABV, 8-5-9-5-18=45\nBlack oil, thin head.

Intense smooth, buttery, woody flavors.  Cherry, licorice, raisin.  Light prickly carbonation.  Not really sweet, but far from dry.  A touch roasty, but just a touch.  A little bitterness in the back there, but no real hoppiness.  Grainy flavor and palate.  Actually reminding me a good bit of Mephistopheles (recent batch) which isn\u2019t a huge compliment, but it\u2019s better than that.  I guess there\u2019s vanilla.  One strong point is the ability to flow between a grainy, deep palate and a rich, smooth one.  Really leaves my mouth stinging long after each sip from the alcohol burn.  Not sweet, but leaving my lips sticky like candy does.  Definitely has a charred wood flavor too.  OK, so this is complex, but it doesn\u2019t feel really well crafted.  The flavors just kinda push each other around and all show up, but they don\u2019t blend and enhance one another like in some beers.  Truth is, though, I generally don\u2019t care for bourbon beers.

Holy crap. What an aroma! The smells bowl me over as they race out of the glass.

So bright and full of character. There\u2019s a great percolation and prickly carbonation that keeps the beer alive on my tongue. In the middle the barrel and it\u2019s alcohols shine in brilliant glory with a ruby fire of passion. Oaky nibs chime in with a faint quaf of parching air and then ebb out towards a charred sensation, with bristling charcoals, seared honey-crusted lamb bones, and toasted nuts. Finally, the deal is sealed with a torch of lemon candy, that reminds me that hops are in this potent brew. Mouthfeel is dense, with coarse grainy sugars and a whole lot of sweetness interplaying with the barrel alcohols. Heat is noticeable in a brandy sense, with coursing vinous behavior, but it\u2019s not upsetting.

I\u2019m finally feeling better now, so it\u2019s time to end the beer drought!  Since it has been so long, I decided that I couldn\u2019t just settle for any beer.  It had to be something big and bold.  Good thing I already had a bottle of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout in the fridge...  BCS pours out a viscous, near black color.  It looks black as night in the glass with a deep mahogany color peaking out around the edges when held up to the light.  This beer is obviously thick.  After the pour, a small head eventually forms as the tiny carbonation bubbles slowly slither upward to the surface.  In addition, the beer leaves a brown, oily sheen on the inside surfaces of the glass (first time I\u2019ve seen this before!).  Charred wood, smoked meat, vanilla, and lots of bourbon are present in the complex and inviting aroma.  The flavor is rich, deep, and complex.  It begins with roasted malt and bourbon with a smoked, meaty quality.  The alcohol is warming and a very nice semi-sweet chocolate flavor with some coffee notes emerge in the finish.  Subsequent drinks reveal more and more chocolate flavor up front and throughout (slightly sweeter too), accompanied by some bourbon, charred wood, and roasted malt flavors.  The finish is slightly more dry with some caramel and cocoa flavors at the very end.  The bourbon flavor is well incorporated, balanced, and complements everything else in this beer very well.  The alcohol is apparent, but also well balanced, nicely integrated, and fits in nicely with the overall character of this beer.  BCS is full bodied and thick as cream, yet smooth and silky at the same time.  It has a wonderful oily characteristic that coats the entire mouth and tongue so that the wonderful flavors linger on and one for quite some time.  Overall this is an amazing stout and an absolute pleasure to drink.

The pour is very black with no real head other than a dark tan ring on the top. Lacing on the goblet is thick. I\u2019m slightly let down by the aroma.

I\u2019ve sampled a few other bourbon-aged brews with a comperable nose. Now, the mouth is where this gem really shines. The flavor is absolutely savory. More espresso, brownies, smoke, and dense, black chocolate come out and intertwine with the sweet vanilla, oak, bourbon notes. The viscous liquid is coating and the whole delivery just sticks to my mouth and lingers for minutes on a savory note of coffee ice cream, bourbon, and a nice cigar.

I was so blown away by this one that I had to get another bottle. The pour is darker than I remember. It\u2019s almost ebony with a small dark tan head. Lacing is dense on the snifter. The aroma is quite rich with deeper complexity than I recall. Yes, the bourbon is laid on thick, but many subtle nuances one finds in a good glass of southern whisky are imparted here: vanilla, smoke, charred oak, all with a chocolaty and roasty background. The mouthfeel is pretty dense and highlights the savory sweet flavors of brownies, vanilla, soft smoke, and coffee. The alcohol warms up my nostrils a bit while I sip this beast. Y\u2019know, this is a very, very good beer.

I once shared a bottle of this w/ matt &amp; pat(both lovers of bourbon).

Touches of charred wood smoke is very dry in the nose and gives some balance to the sweet coconut, chocolate fudge, vanilla and light alcohol.  Being very underwhelmed by most Imperial Stouts I have tried lately, especially the barrel-aged ones, I\u2019ve got to say, I was incredibly impressed and refreshed by this one.  Granted this isnt a terribly refreshing beer, but it was just nice to see a unique imperial stout that dosent bludgeon you with hops or alcohol.  Even the roast is fairly restrained here, relatively speaking.  What you do get a lot of, is coconut, sweet vanilla beans and chocolate fudge, though a bit drier than all that sounds.  Rich, thick mouthfeel is borderline syrupy, and significantly malty sweet, but for me, it works.  Very viscous and oily, with a very low carbonation.  It goes down easy, on my palate, though.  The bourbon is somehow flavorul, moreso than it is drying or sharp.  Sweet chocolate-vanilla sticks with you, as some late hops grows as it warms.  Bourbony flavors are always present but don\u2019t really bother me, even at the end of the glass.  Very full body.  Love to get more of this stuff.\nRerate  Or rather, resample, I\u2019m not changing my marks because this beer is maturing very nicely.

I was wrong about this the first time I had it.  This is not over-rated.  My biggest complaint the first time I had it was that it smelled exactly like dog food.  While I still smell a little bit of it, especially right out of the bottle, it\u2019s not dominating.  What is dominating is the utter balance of the smell; in equal parts, we have plumy dark chocolate, brown sugar, and a very fruity warm bourbon aroma.  Wonderful.  If it weren\u2019t for the lingering dog food smell, this would be a 9 smell, potentially 10 (I really don\u2019t like the dog food).  Looks are a very high 4, almost 5.  This is maybe the darkest head I\u2019ve seen.  It produces a somewhat sticky lace wall, and the racing is fairly deep and slow.  Of course, the beer itself is triple distilled crude oil reduced and congealed, ie thick as all hell.  It\u2019s just as thick as it looks in the mouth, even thicker than melted chocolate.  The thickness is soft and velvety, and is really a unique experience (I don\u2019t remember Dark Lord or BA Speedway feeling like this; those are the only two that might match it).  You feel the alcohol numbing your face after half a glass, but you don\u2019t taste it.  The body of this thing absorbs everything.  The flavor starts as rich as the feel, very fruity with a bourbon character.  Yet, unlike many bourbon aged stouts, the bourbon here is in perfect balance; it is a complement, not the defining feature.  The bridge is a sweetish milk chocolate transitioning into the hoppy finish, which is roasty and moderately bitter.  Eventually, the finish rounds into a baker\u2019s cocoa dryness.  In sum, I have to say I\u2019m sorry for what I said before, Bourbon County.  Please forgive me.  ORIGINAL RATING: 3.6.  2005 bottle into small shaker, Hop Leaf, Chicago IL.  After checking a couple bottle shops for this and not finding it, I was happy to see it at Hop Leaf.  Maybe the scarcity is why they are charging $10 a bottle.  I was drinking it with some non-beer geek friends who weren\u2019t that into it.  My buddy Vivek said, \"Oh, that smells like ass.  Like a fat ass,\" whatever that means.  I thought it smelled like dog food fresh from the bag, with some bourbon underneath and a teeny bit of vanilla bean.  The dog food smell went away as the beer warmed, or maybe because I got used to it, but the first impression was negative.  Inky black in the glass with a medium brown fizzy head that doesn\u2019t last long.  Feels full as hell and oily with noticable alcohol.  Dry roast in the finish with a bourbon tang.  Middle is sweet with some liquid chocolate (of both the milk and semi-sweet variety), but the flavors get consumed by the massiveness of the body.  The bourbon is at a nice level, almost too much but definitely not; I think they found the inflection point.  This had me thinking the whole way through that Goose Island was trying to make a Dark Lord clone.  The size was impressive, and considering it the balance was impressive too (with semi-dry hops on the end and the roast drying it out a bit), but none of the elements jumped out as objectively dope.

True, I\u2019m an absolute sucker for stouts aged in bourbon barrels, but even compared to others of similar ilk, Goose Island\u2019s offering is absolutely incredible.

Sweet, malty, roasty, and bitter, with all seemingly in perfect unison and balance.  Sitting on top of all that is a strong, but not overwhelming bourbon flavor, fruity and cherry-like, that takes this beer to heights rarely attained in the beer universe.  Alcohol is fairly strong, and as the beer warms, shows a bit too much relative potency.  The aroma is gorgeous, extraordinarily balanced between roast, sweetness, maltiness and bourbon.  This is a treat for the palate as well as the nose.  Full bodied, yet soft, velvety and caressing, this is palatal bliss.  Fairly viscous, somewhat sticky, but not syrupy, a quick swirl leaves a thin brown film on the glass.  The major negative is with the visuals.  The beer is very dark brown, slightly ruddy at the edges, which isn\u2019t the issue.  When I popped the twist-off cap, there was almost no sound, and pouring the beer, it took several seconds for a small, quarter inch of head to form, and then that completely dissipated before I could rinse out the bottle.  Nevertheless, while visuals are nice, they don\u2019t make or break a beer for me.  I\u2019m gonna be thinking of this beer for days, months, years.  Incredible stuff, and I must obtain more, but this time, I\u2019ll try to get more than just a single bottle.

You should aim for the current bottling according to CaptainCougar\u2019s review of this and the older bottling.\r\n\r\nRERATE: New batch, was able to drive to my local liquor store and get, thats exciting! Bottled 08.16.05. Served at 57.6\u00b0 in a NB worthy glass. I\u2019m sure the appearance  is the same as last time. That bourbon is in the mose, lets hope it isn\u2019t overpowering in the taste, that was one of the things I LOVED about the last one. Aroma is large, chocolately malt with oak, vanilla, alcohol, coffee, a bright fruitness, maybe a bit of pine. The inital taste is chocolately malt, coffee, oak, vanilla followed by a rush of alcohol and bourbon flavors along with some fruity bitterness and astringent coffee. The bourbon is in this beer, it is very strong, in fact, but the sheer size of this beer, combined with its other strong flavors, is able to contain it. This beer is a mouthfull and leaves a definate burn in the mouth.  The body is large  but the alcohol really cuts through it. I seem to remember that the alcohol is accentuated as this beer warms, probably will try it again straight from the cellar on a cold winter day.

Whhooffda! This sucker is nicely heated. Still in check though, much like the aroma, the chocolate tones tend to supersede over the top of the flavors but staying underneath the alcoholic heat. An interesting effect. Super awesome finish, subtle, warming, late return of chocolate after the heat settles off leaving leftovers of crispened charred vanilla bean, caramel stickies, and sweet, sweet bourbon. Oh my, what an encapsulated ride of fun this stuff is, wow! That sweet bourbony heat builds strongly and just cinders for what seems an eternity while all the other stuff play underneath.\r\n\r\nFeel is powerfully heated with a bourbony sweetness and back-throated burn that is absolutely awesome to behold.

All emphasis is on the fudgy malts and bourbon, leaving only a glimpse of dark fruity esters. Soft and viscous on the palate. Velvety, spongy carbonation. Immensely complex notes of vanilla and dark chocolate, trailed by a mild vinous tingle and a touch of toasted wood and raisins. Grainy caramelized sugars  cushion the rich chocolate and soft vanilla to perfection. Finishes shockingly rich yet balanced by a mixture of black malt char, bourbon, oak, and caramel.  Fudge and molasses notes coat the tongue as the bourbon lingers to seal the deal. Extremely luscious.  (9,5,9,4,18)\r\n2005: \r\nSomething has drastically changed. Both the foam and  body are doubtlessly on the lighter side. Carbonation is also less dense than the 2004 and the silky viscosity is no longer evident. Charred barrel character is still in full force as it acts as the anchor, but the finish is overwhelmingly brash with alcohol, medicine, and body-thinning tannins. And it\u2019s overly sweet, mushy, and rampant with sweet and husky corn notes. No definitive vinous notes or fruity esters, whatsoever. Good, but this is not the gem that it was a year ago. Among other things, this particular batch needs a lengthy slumber in the cellar to tone down the alcohol. Currently it comes across as just another mushy, oversweet, bourbon-saturated makeshift Imperial that has only suffered by being aged in a bourbon barrel.
