A yeasty taste with a light banana flavor ten comes to the tongue. The brew is smooth and malty up front, but as the taste moves on the beer sours up. Flavors of a lemon citrus enter the tongue more toward the middle of the taste.. Some flavors of coriander and a herbal/grassy funk flavor meld with the sour flavors more toward the end. At the finish of the taste a quite sour citrus flavor of orange and lemon mixed with a light bitter nature of a funky grassy/herbal hop taste and some spices linger on the tongue leaving a rather satisfying sour funked taste to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer was on the average side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is just slightly above average. The slightly higher carbonation is quite nice for the sour, funky, and citrus flavors of the brew. This coupled with the medium body make in very drinkable and quite appropriate for the style and flavors. \r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 This was a nice easy drinking Belgian saison with a nice blend of sour/bitter/funk/malt One to try if you get a chance.", "writed_at": "August 20, 2014"}, {"user_id": "Gerbeer", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \uc18c\ud53c", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Sofie", "review_score": 3.8, "review_content": "750 ml bottle.

The biggest distinguishing factor of this beer was that it was tart. Not super tart like the fantome saison I\u2019ve had (Thanks mike), but a tier below that. The flavors were complex, but not powerful. I usually like my saisons to have a ton of yeast flavors, but this one chose to use the yeast more towards the tart end, which gave a greater array of flavors. The beer also finished fairly smooth for a saison, but had some bit in the middle.

Nose is alarmingly fruity, heavy jammy marmalade, principally orange, with fruity yeast and lovely white pepper, white grape, muscat, floral, some honey and vanilla, classic Saison. Pours golden with a soapy white head. Crisp, honeyed taste, lightly sweet with juicy citrus and jam, leaning a bit exotic though not quite, and a pleasant bit of mild rind with soft wood and luscious fruit right up the middle. Tannic bite is rounded and helps with volume, wheat is done juuust right and blends with the tartness.  The wilder and potentially chaotic elements are downplayed, but what is emphasized is worthy -- very full and complex. The spicy and occasional hoppy flourishes are harmonious contributors.  Medium body is oily, slightly warming. Amazing that the US now has ready access to something like this. [2014.02.03: 4.0]\n\n750mL bottle bottled on 30JAN14, here over a year-and-a-half later.  Mildly, very slowly gushy, but the glass is 90% foam, bright white and rocky, above clear yellow-golden.  Same flora/citric Saison nose as the last time, still fresh with a touch of wood amid the strong orange.  Oily in the mouth, slightly warming, dash of white pepper, sunny malty disposition.  Very vibrant and fresh, growing pineapple, lemon, very faint hint of musk (not quite vomit) in the deep bg, but the overall impression is squeaky clean and fresh, lively.  Vanilla and honey have faded, there\u2019s a slightly more pronounced phenolic character [perhaps because some other obscuring elements have faded], and there\u2019s even a jammy/berry character I haven\u2019t noticed before.  Little bit foamy/gassy, but smooth and comforting, and man if that pineapple hasn\u2019t taken off for the stratosphere!  Lightly tart, a touch warming/boozy, floral and somewhat rustic, beautiful and elegant.  No reason to drink these fresh when aged bottles are so magnificent.

There is just a hint of spiciness creeping through.\r\n\r\nTaste: Dry white wine notes with a touch of apple and pear up front followed by Belgian yeast, mild phenols and a touch of funk in the middle before ending with a bit of black pepper. Aftertaste is dry and mild with Belgian yeast dominating. This is clearly a Belgian-style saison. \r\n\r\nMouthfeel: Light-to-medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation.\r\n\r\nDrinkability: Excellent drinkability. You won\u2019t have any trouble polishing off the bomber alone.\r\n\r\nOverall: Very good beer overall. I would recommend giving this one a try. I\u2019d like to try it fresh to compare.

I had heard of it before too; it was one of those breweries out East that folks would go into a frenzy for, grabbing their spears and performing weird rituals in the dead of night to secure a bottle of this or that. Goose Island was one of the names uttered in their shamanistic trances, but I didn\u2019t think much of it. Out in Seattle we were too far away, and no amount of trading or haggling would be worth the effort to acquire a bottle. But then, one day, there it was. It occupied a spot on the shelf of my local QFC, as if it had always been there. I stared at it for awhile, until an old lady severed my achilles in half with a rusty cart. This compelled me to pick up the beer and hobble to the cashier to take my new prize home and see what the fuss was about. And I still don\u2019t get it. A golden body pours from the bottle, and features a thick white head. The aroma is bright, but transparent, and seems rarefied, left with only slight scents of corn and wheat and a bland, generic sweetness. The flavor is bitter, far too carbonated, and sometime after the mid-taste it tapers down to a clean but simple lager and honey aftertaste.

Pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nT: One word describes this: subtle. Subtle light fruit esters (apple, banana, cherry) are augmented by subtle malts, subtle spicing and a subtle hop finish, all backed by a subtle underlying funk. In addition, the finish is vaguely reminiscent of white wine at times. Truth be told, it\u2019s subtle to the point of lacking flavor slightly...maybe I\u2019ve had too many DIPAs lately. Only a modicum of complexity overall, although the barnyard funk does accumulate fairly well. In spite of all this (or maybe because of this?), it goes down very easy.\r\n\r\nM: Fairly intense carbonation, with a tiny bit of yeast astringency along with low dryness, perhaps a little less than I want from a saison. Thankfully, the yeast has perhaps calmed down to where it doesn\u2019t hinder drinkability with excessive heaviness on the palate.\r\n\r\nO: Pretty damn good, especially considering saisons aren\u2019t one of my more favored styles.

Grassy (especially lemon grass) along with hay. Some barnyard saison and wild yeast and funky aroma. Touch of a white wine and spice. Very complex and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nT - Taste is also very complex. Plenty of fruitiness that mirrors the nose. Mid-sip, it definitely has a white wine type of flavor, although it isn\u2019t particularly vinous. A nice woody flavor with a good dose of vanilla also comes out to support that wine flavor. Has an underlying funk that is a great compliment to the other flavors and doesn\u2019t overtake them. There is always a strong underlying orange/lemon rind and lemon grass citrusy flavor, but toward the finish it comes out particularly strong along with a nice spiciness featuring white pepper, clove, coriander, and a hint of cumin amongst other spices.\r\n\r\nM - Medium body with a bit above average carbonation. A zesty, active feel with a drying finish. Very champagne/sparkling wine like feel that accompanies the white wine taste well.\r\n\r\nD - Complex but balanced beer that is a delight to sip.

Pours clear honeyed golden/straw in colour. Later cloudy as I added the sediment. Bright white reasonably dense head which persists more than I would have imagined. Aroma is classic belgian blonde/saison/wheat beer-ish. Lots of lemon citrus, lots of lemon peel and obviously orange peel. Spices, yeast, and bread in the back ground, also a slight sulphurous/farmyard character, wet hay and so on. Classic aromas a plenty, basically. Flavour is more of the same, citrus is the flavour of the day, with loads of lemon and orange, fruit peel, not as tart as I would have expected - but this is good, I think. Nice use of balance between sweet and sharp. Lots of bready yeast and malt to balance. Reminds me of a tart lemon drizzle cake. Slight lemon sherbet quality to it in the mids and into the finish. Some sharp Lemon meringue as well. Very refreshing. I know only 20% of the beer used was aged in barrels, but still there is little, if any oak flavour imparted into the beer... I don\u2019t know if this is a good or bad thing. On the one hand, showing no oak, basically makes this a very well made Belgian beer out of the US, but this makes me think it\u2019s essentially a bit over priced for what it is. On the other hand, would an overly woody element done the brew any favours, perhaps not, though arguably there is the faintest touch of vanilla sweetness, which I suppose is the oak, but this is very subtle, so the debate still stands, is this a very well made, but somewaht overpriced Belgian/US beer, or does it deserve the price as a pint of solid beer? Mouthfeel is spot on, better than most Belgians could have pulled off.

The beer is a pale honey color that shows a lightly hazed, straw gold color when held up to the light.  It is amply carbonated with a whole lot of streaming bubbles flowing up through it.  The aroma smells of hay, orange blossoms, orange zest, a touch of musty phenolics, lots of pale grain notes, a sort of weed like dried grassiness, some light herbal honey aromatics and a healthy grain note that becomes more prominent the more you dig into the aroma.  As the beer warms the honey like note gets more prominent, though it always remains well balanced with the other aromatic notes.  A touch of alcohol is also noticeable as the beer warms.\n\n\r\n\r\nMy first sip of this tastes quite dry from beginning through the end of the flavor profile.  There is a grassy herbal note that lightly spices this beer as well as some spiciness that reminds me of black pepper, orange zest, some turpene like clove notes, some grassy notes that seem to taste a touch like sage..  This has a lively, peppery carbonation that provides lots of carbonic acid to the finish.  This has a underlying mustiness to it and a general earthiness that makes me think that a Dupont derived strain of yeast might have been used in this beer.  The flavor has a really nice pale grain, pale cracker grain character that is really quite prominent.\n\n\r\n\r\nMy second pour of this is quite murky and full of sediment.  Since I don\u2019t spend so much time examining the nose, the beer is also quite a bit more carbonated, but the sediment doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the flavor too much.  Both the nose and the aroma see me noticing a bit more fruitiness than before; it almost reminds me a bit of some oaked Sauvignon Blanc and / or Chardonnay grapes somehow; there are also hints of melon, pear and a suggestion of kiwi.  The beer definitely is quite herbal / grassy, with perhaps a touch of yeasty wholesomeness that mixes with the crushed grain notes and provides a touch more hearty character to this otherwise light beer.  Speaking of which, this beer is nice and light bodied; while dry, there is enough body to not make this seem watery at all.  This has a certain palate presence that provides just a touch of fullness to this beer; it is quite nicely balanced towards being quaffable and refreshing.  There is a very subtle oak influence, one that I likely wouldn\u2019t have picked out if I didn\u2019t know about it, but it does add some spiciness and some texture to this beer that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be here.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe aroma of this beer has a soft sweetness to it (the honey and orange like notes) that doesn\u2019t translate to the mostly dry flavor.  I definitely like this character in my Saisons, which should be quite dry.  This is a very nice beer; it has a really nice mix of flavors / aromas and is quite easy drinking.  I could easily stand to have quite a few of these bottles about as these will likely age for at least another year quite well.  Without having had Juliet yet, I almost wonder if this is the better beer of the two; I\u2019ll have to confirm that when I crack a bottle of Juliet.

Taste is very countryside field.  Dry hay, lemongrass, wild flowers, grapefruits skin, omnipresent bready yeast, bubblegum.  Very farmhouse and wild but not to the point of being funky.

Nice tartness and dryness work, especially being brought up as a Champagne person. Decent body, light and flavorful, carbonation helps it balance on the palate. Aging will likely change this brew\u2019s makeup.

Pours golden with a frothy white head. Nice head retention for almost the entire beer. Aroma is of yeast, citrus, pickles, hops, and honey.

Has a nice malt backbone on it. Nice dry wine characteristics and some woodiness come through. Mouthfeel is very light due to the carbonation. Finish is very peppery.

Big billowy white head. Not rocky, but some smooth moguls as a settles. Nice tatting on the side on the glass. Lips curl slightly upward with the first sniff. A sudden burst of scents, with pale malt, lemon curd, dough, horse blanket, white pepper, sweet basil, rosemary, and orange blossom honey rising in the nostrils. Pale malt in the start and well into the middle. Floral and herbal hops in the middle balance the light sweetness. Just hints of citrus and spice to make this one crisp and light. Linger has a return of pale, lightly buttery malt. I see the description says Champagne, but I \u2019m thinking Chardonnay. A nice airy feel, but yet there is some real meat/heft to be found in this one. Quite Hennepin-esque and approaching Temptation. So... good company in my book.
