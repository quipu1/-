Jednak by\u0142bym dla niego bardziej wyrozumia\u0142y i narzuci\u0142 po prostu mi\u0119dzynarodowego jasnego Lagera, cho\u0107 podczas degustacji zauwa\u017cy\u0142em, \u017ce wcale taki typowy rozwodniony Lager to to nie jest. Ale zacznijmy najpierw od naczynia. Jest to zwyk\u0142a puszka, wi\u0119c koloru i piany nie oceni\u0119. Zapach jest przyjemny. Czu\u0107 znacznie alkohol troch\u0119 spirytusowy i koncernowy, ale nie a\u017c tak mocno jak np. w Kr\u00f3lewskie. Towarszyszy mu nuta s\u0142odu, ale  nie za mocna. Jest to piwo Pure Malt Lager, czyli jest tam tylko s\u0142\u00f3d j\u0119czmienny, woda i chmiel. Podsumowuj\u0105c zapach to mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce zach\u0119ca do picia. \nPo \u0142yku wyczu\u0107 mo\u017cna wod\u0119 gazowan\u0105, czyli nic. Jednak potem wy\u0142ania si\u0119  alkohol z nutami spirytusu z  bardzo lekkim posmakiem s\u0142odu i zaskakuj\u0105cym goryczkowym finishem. Jak na Euro Lagera goryczkowo\u015b\u0107 jest bardzo dobra. Mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce przewy\u017csza o wiele s\u0142odowo\u015b\u0107. Goryczka nie jest garbnikowa ! Stawia to piwo gdzie\u015b pomi\u0119dzy Euro Lagerem, a Pilsem je\u015bli chodzi o chmiel. Jednak bardzo ma\u0142o cia\u0142a i wyczuwalny alkohol, kt\u00f3ry dodatkowo ma akompaniament minimalnego DMS (ale to bardzo minimalnego) i \u017celaza spycha to piwo na Euro Lagera. Wi\u0119c czym jest Carlsberg ? Wed\u0142ug mnie na pewno nie Pilsem z prawdziwego zdarzenia. Kupuj\u0105c go bior\u0119 go za lepszego koncerniaka i patrz\u0119 na niego jako Euro Lager, ale ten lepszy. I taki w\u0142a\u015bnie jest Carlsberg.

So the Carlsberg here is quite a good, trustworthy lager. The strongest is the draught obviously, great creamy foam, deep golden colour, expressive and pleasent malty aromas. The small bottle is great also, a bit compressed, but also a very drinkable and rich lager. Canned is good also, no metallic taste in the background, pure aromas and taste. The big bottle... I don't know, it's like a shadow of the small bottle, not very rich, watery on the palate, somehow it's more weak than the others.

Found out how much better Carslberg, then Hof, tasted and never looked back. Even persuaded my girlfriend, now my life\u2019s companon, that Carlsberg is superior in taste. Today , the family, including our 22 year old son, agree. Carlsberg is the standard upon which pilsners/lagers are measured. And though not among the great, it fares well. LIght golden yellow with a white head. Aroma of malt, citrus, bread and pine. Taste slightly sweet and malty. I strikes me that I am drinking this too warm! Should be about 5 degrees, but then again, I get a long, malty aftertaste, which is more than I bargained for. Nuff said! I still like this old stablemate.

As the taste advances a little bit of grassiness begins developing on the tongue. The grassiness grows a bit stronger, which in the end with the malt and the lighter caramel flavors, leaves a crisp and clean taste to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner side with a carbonation level that is rather average.

So, when I was at a meeting in the union and Carlsberg Hof was served, I took the chance as I\u2019d never buy this stuff by myself anymore. This is of course the standard danish bottled version at 4,6% ABV. Appearance is quite standard: Deep golden and with a somewhat lasting, bubbly head. The first dissapointment was the aroma. Allthough, I already at the time had realised that this wasn\u2019t gonna blow me away in a mouth and tongue orgasm, I expected more from the aroma than this indistinct sour aroma that oozed from the glass. Luckily, the flavour was way better. This is actually a rather well-tasting pale lager. It starts out with the sourishness from the aroma, but then it actually shows some slightly traceable yeast and some rather obvious malts. In a way, these malts seems more roasted than in the usual standard lager, and the flavour all in all seems not as diluted as many other big commercial macrobrew brands. Finish is bitter hopped, but of course not more than making sure that it appeals to the hordes of beer drinking festival guests and random guys at couches in their living rooms. Palate is soft, but carbonation is a bit to strong for my liking, and thereupon the brew seems a bit watery.

I was first introduced to this beer when I was on active duty in the U.S. Navy and my ship pulled into Copenhagen, Denmark for a liberty port visit. I remember drinking Carlsberg at every bar and restaurant I went, mostly because it was not only the city\u2019s hometown beer, but of all Denmark\u2019s as well. Having visited many other European cities I noticed it was popular and available everywhere I went. I remember thinking it was okay at the time but it didn\u2019t leave much of a long-term impression on me.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve matured as an appreciator of beer I\u2019m able to sit down and analyze Carlsberg for what it really is: the Budweiser of Europe. I don\u2019t mean that as a compliment nor as a criticism, but mostly just a cultural comparison. It\u2019s a drinkable beer with a decent taste but there isn\u2019t anything remarkable about it.\n\nPOUR, COLOR AND AROMA\n\nThe beer pours smoothly to a clear straw color and forms a well-proportioned, bright white, foamy head which never completely dissipates and leaves significant lacing on the glass. Upon first pouring this beer has a very active amount of carbonation, but as it sits it calms down to the point of being almost completely tepid. This would be normal for a craftier brew like a brown ale or stout, but since Carlsberg is a pilsner it\u2019s quite strange.\n\nThe aroma is fairly standard for a beer of the type, but the difference is this beer has a distinctly sweeter scent. It\u2019s just slightly floral and fruity, not just standard malts as most beers of the type. \n\nTASTE\n\nI haven\u2019t tasted Carlsberg in nearly two years but all those memories came rushing back as I drank my first bottle. I remember thinking this beer tasted pretty generic at the time and drinking it now I find that to still be true. \n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever had Budweiser, Miller, or Coors will be familiar with the basic taste of Carlsberg. The difference being this beer is slightly sweeter and doesn\u2019t have the green apple aftertaste of the big American lagers. This is a pilsner after all, so it has a much crisper, cleaner taste than a standard lager. \n\nIn fact, the problem with Carlsberg is that it\u2019s so clean it\u2019s bland. There isn\u2019t much of a distinctive flavor noticeable here. It\u2019s a generic beer taste that\u2019s almost watery.\n\nFINISH\n\nI remember drinking a round of Carlsberg with my shipmates and noticing everyone comment to the effect that the beer was easy to drink. This is probably what makes it such a top seller since people will opt for a beer that\u2019s easy to drink over a beer that\u2019s well-flavored. \n\nCarlsberg\u2019s thin taste is complimented by a smooth finish. Had it been even remotely coarse I think this would have been a mediocre beer, but the fact it drinks as if it were water puts it in good standing with most drinkers.\n\nBODY\n\nI don\u2019t know of too many pilsners that are anything other than light in weight. Such beers are intentionally light in body and Carlsberg is no exception. I wasn\u2019t able to confirm the amount of calories per serving, but I would guess it\u2019s fewer than 150. Additionally, at 5% ABV it\u2019s a bit more potent than Americans are used to for this style of beer. But then again this is the type of beer that can and should be accompanied by food so most drinkers probably wouldn\u2019t feel overwhelmed.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI was under the misconception that Carlsberg is considered a fantastic brew on a global scale, but after doing a little research on the internet I realized it\u2019s generally considered average no matter who you ask. I guess it\u2019s that crown on the label that threw me.\n\nNOTE: Watch the video version of this review here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXzOcGg7LhQ", "writed_at": "February 14, 2010"}, {"user_id": "sw", "beer_kor_name": "\uce7c\uc2a4\ubc84\uadf8", "beer_eng_name": "Carlsberg Pilsner", "review_score": 3.1, "review_content": "Aroma-Very light malt based with some slight hay/grass hops.\r\nAppearance-Bright medium dark straw with white frothy head\r\nFlavour-Cereal malt driven with plenty of well rounded bitterness\r\nMouthfeel-Dry and crisp with out being fresh.\r\nOverall- for the style, this beer meets all criteria without being a stand out.", "writed_at": "February 10, 2010"}, {"user_id": "StaffieBNT", "beer_kor_name": "\uce7c\uc2a4\ubc84\uadf8", "beer_eng_name": "Carlsberg Pilsner", "review_score": 2.1, "review_content": "Danish Version:\r\n\r\nSweet malt with mild earth note.

And this beer deserves to be amongst the first 1000 and it deserves this exact spot. Why?  Well H.C. Andersen said \"Herfra min verden g\u00e5r\" (From here my world endeavours). This holds true for this exact beer and my beerworld as well. In the lack of diversity one \"learns\" to adapt and accept a beer like this as \"what beer is\". This isn\u2019t bad, just the way Carlsberg over the years have excerted their attitude towards the Danish beerscene has been bad, they have improved. Their people are all talented brewers, they just happen to work in a company that has to sell in big quantities to sustain in a global market - therefore it becomes mainstream. But on a warm summerday this beer does exactly what it should and the product they produce is ALWAYS the same - fact.

As long as it was of European origin, and as long as it was fairly cheap it would do.  I had blown all my money on good bread and genuine Stilton cheese, so what quid I had left would hardly be able to fill the bill for a fancy Belgian beer.  So off I went, walking and walking back to my youth hostel, seeing a scant few pubs, all of which looked commercialized or chained.  I wanted to go somewhere with historical significance mind you, like \u201cThe Eagle and Child\u201d, but apparently what wasn\u2019t doable in Bath.  Defeated and tired I crawled back into my Youth Hostel, only to remember they had a small bar open during evening hours.  There I went with, huffing and puffing, bent on having a European beer before I died from the long, acclivitous walk.  And all they served was Carlsberg.  Fine.  The beer\u2019s name ended in \u201cBerg\u201d, and that sounded European enough.  To me it looked and smelled like the average canned lagers here in the states, but the taste was a bit more refined.  By refined I mean it didn\u2019t send my digestive organs into immediate revolt.  That bit took about twenty minutes.  As time passed it felt like the Carlsberg was eating away at my stomach ling, bubbling and boiling away, probably manifesting itself into some embryonic demon-beast prepared to burst from my gut the next full moon.  My body must have sensed the imminent danger because the next thing I knew I was in a deep sleep somewhere in the living room.  Thanks to the efforts of my primal instincts I woke up an hour later, groggy and confused, but alive.

The flavour was much the same, above average levels of grainy pale malts and modest hop bitterness in macrobrew terms, but a mild overall experience - the bitterness was not near as assertive as that of the regrettable TFC loss to the Montreal Impact.
