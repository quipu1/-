Reasonable amount of visible carbonation. Pretty nice - I'd like the head to be a little more persistent I think but not a major complaint.\n\nAroma isn't bad - reminiscent of an ESB or similar to me. Some caramel, some brown bread malt, something slightly sweeter - liquorice? Vanilla? Maybe a hint of spice? I like it - perhaps a touch subtle, but a nice array of notes from the malts.\n\nTaste is good. Again, there's some almost vanilla like sweetness, but there's definitely also a dried fruit note, a touch of caramel, a hint of bready malt and a gentle earthy bitterness to finish. Well-balanced throughout. Again, maybe a touch subtle, but it's very pleasant - reminiscent of a porter.\n\nPalate is okay. Medium-light body, a moderate amount of in-mouth carbonation, smooth throughout. A touch thin at the front, but becomes slightly drier during the moderate length finish. I want a little more body.\n\nOverall, I quite like this. It's generally subtle, but well-balanced with a nice mix of sweeter and maltier notes. Not much from the hops, but that's not a problem for a dark lager for me.

Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, herbal, wood, grass, light smoke/nuts, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, herbal, wood, grass, light smoke/nuts, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy hop and roast bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, herbal, wood, grass, smoke, nuts, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great hop/roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from hop/roast bitterness. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy, and fairly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a delicious schwarzbier!
