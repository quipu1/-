Little whiff of light-struck hops on opening, but faint and soon gone. However, it does seem daft in this day and age to persist in using green bottles which offer little protection for the hops. This is a professionally made pale lager. Soft sweet malt with a little flutter of hops. It's actually not bad. If looking for a quick thirst quencher of a hot day, this would slip down better for me than many modern craft lagers and lager and lime style beers. Pleasant, clean, inoffensive, and quite tasty for a global pale lager. [2.6] \n \nAug, 2004 Bottle.  Head to Head with Bud. Pale yellow appearance. Pale malt aroma - very light. Just beat Bud on both counts, but only by a fraction. Honey in nose, honey in flavour. Bud initially more flavoursome, but the Bud vanishes quickly and turns watery.

Taste of big cracker, lightly toasted biscuit, white bread dough, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, lightly toasted biscuit, white bread dough, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bitterness. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is an awesome Czech pilsner! All around great robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the balancing bitter/drying finish. Perfectly executed style example. Never too bitter/drying, and very flavorful for the ABV. Clean pils malt flavors with balancing Saaz hops.

Feb 5, 2020. 2.9)\n\nAroma: Sweet and sour, maltiness, some hops. 2) Sightly sweet/dank malt, hint of bread/dough. 4-&gt;4\nAppearance: nice looking beer with moderate head. good color for a lager/pilsner. 2) respectable initial head, does fade a bit fast to almost nothing, as before, nice color for a lager/pils, tad orangey/honey yellow. 4-&gt;3\nTaste: Rich lager taste, some yeast and bread, tartness, moderate bitterness. Not as hoppy as top-notch pilsners. 2) solid graininess, toast and bread crust, enough pilsy hops bitterness on the finish. 5-&gt;6\nPalate: Clean, tart, simple but enjoyable. 2) light to medium light, crisp, slightly creamy and well balanced. 3-&gt;3\n\nOverall: Definitely better than American Bud, but not as good as Urquell. 2) solid beer, a bit weak upfront and not super complex in flavor, but solid grain and pils hoppiness. a couple notches above some cheap mass-market euro lager. 12-&gt;13", "writed_at": "February 6, 2020"}, {"user_id": "PiwnyMarek", "beer_kor_name": "\ubd80\ub4dc\ubc14\uc774\uc800 \ubd80\ub4dc\ubc14", "beer_eng_name": "Budweiser Budvar", "review_score": 2.8, "review_content": "Daje rad\u0119.

First, the review, then the secrets.\r\n\r\nDeep gold, more than two or three fractions darker than most Czech pils. Bright white head, that never seems to stay around that long.\r\n\r\nNose is deep, soft, sweet crackery maltiness perfectly mixed with spicy slightly grassy Saaz. Tiniest touch of sulphur. So simple, yet so compelling. Utterly irresistable to this drinker.\r\n\r\nFull side of medium in the mouth, with a slight sweetness leading the way. This quickly gives way to a rich, soft maltiness. The spicy hop flavor comes on in the mid-palate, seamlessly blending with the malt. Incredibly long finish that gently sees the hops move to the fore, and it is their bitterness that ultimately ends things. Sheer perfection.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel is so soft - the beer glides into every nook and cranny. I could easily accidently drown myself in this one, and all I\u2019d have is a big stupid grin on my face. God beer when it\u2019s on.\r\n\r\nSo, here are the secrets: (1) only buy closed cases, or, if buying less than a case, from a closed case, as it gets light struck easily; (2) the cases, but not the six packs or bottles have a best before date - the beer is as described above during the last three months preceeding the best before date and about one month after - too early and it\u2019s a bit coarse, too late and the hops don\u2019t properly balance it; (3) only buy from retailers who care about their stock and have not kept it somewhere warm; and (4) don\u2019t buy it in the summer, unless you know your distributor and retailer keep things at the proper temperature as it heat damages easily.

The beer is a brilliantly clear, copper hued, full gold color.  The aroma has a sweet malty note to it up front that has touches of toffee to it, but finishes off with a nice biscuit malt aroma.  The hop aromatics seem to have faded a bit compared to the fresher examples of this that I have had in Germany (but that was years ago), but there is a touch of spicy hop aromas here in the middle.  Notably a touch of grassy hops mixes in with the malt notes and a touch of herbal is just perceptible.\n\n\r\n\r\nThe beer is quite a bit drier than I was expecting from the nose and has a nice solid bitterness to it that starts as a nice hop bite in the beginning.  In fact the hops are much more prominent in the flavor than in the aroma; here the grassy, almost hay like hop character looms quite large in the flavor profile.  There is a touch of herbal lemon character (sort of like lemon grass or maybe even lemon thyme), especially in the finish where a light tartness seems to magnify it a bit.  Just a hint of diacetyl seems to round out the malt components; it seems to add a touch of toffee to the finish.  The finish also has a nice solid bitter note to it that lingers a bit on the tongue.

But there is another Budweiser beer, from the Budvar Brewery in the Czech Republic, called Budweiser Budvar, and they call their Budweiser The Beer of Kings. That\u2019s right, thereis another Bud, but this Bud isn\u2019t for you, not if you live in the United States. AB and Budvar have battled this out in court over the years, over the use of the name Budweiser. That has just recently changed, as of 2001, Budweiser Budvar is now on the US market, but under the label Czechvar. \r\n\r\nThe American Bud actually came first(AB has been in business longer than Budvar), but the name itself is derived from the town of Budweis, in you guessed it, the Czech Republic. This beer is sold mainly in European countries, where American Bud isn\u2019t sold, but I suspect that has changed. AB has made a big push in Europe as of late, its very popular in Ireland, taps flowing freely next to Guinness. American Budweiser has made it into a number of European markets as B or Bud. My first experience with this beer came in occupied Northern Ireland, I saw it in bottles in a few pubs I visited in Belfast, and later brought some back to the US for future consumption and to share with other beer lovers. Anyone who has seen Michael Jackson\u2019s The Beer Hunter Series knows the story behind this elusive Budweiser. So for a beer lover at the time, this beer was a rare and special treat. \r\n\r\nBudweiser Budvar pours to a deep, bright golden color, with a creamy white head, and a lively carbonation. The nose is very fragrant with that classic Bohemian Red hop aroma, what we know as the Saaz hop. This is a very \"fresh cut grass\" hop aroma. There is also a good bit of crisp pilsner malt aroma as well, and a touch of DMS(sulphur like aroma). The palate is wonderful. It is firm, crisp, and clean. Really some great malt flavors. The body is smooth and round, this is a very drinkable lager. Budweiser Budvar finishes with some crisp maltiness up front, then leads into a snappy, grassy, bitter hop bite. This is a great drinking beer, very balanced. I\u2019ll take the Beer of Kings over the King of Beers, any day. Expect to pay more for this Bud though, and more than other Czech pilsners on the market, that are of equal, or better quality. This is a great beer, but it has been over hyped, and now that it is here, I suspect the mystique of the \"other\" Budweiser will wear off.
