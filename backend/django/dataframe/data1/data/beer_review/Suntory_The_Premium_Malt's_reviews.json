No, the Boshin sensou hasn\u2019t re-ignited, but their is a battle of wits and laws and economics being waged, and the prize is the hearts, minds and guts of Japan\u2019s affable quaffers. One of the keystones of the macrobrewers is the Suntory Premium Malts - unfortunately, it is the Lexus of the beer aisle at 7-11 or Suntory\u2019s, in price and prestige. In all fairness, the taste is fuller, thicker, pairing that universal pale lager bitterness with genuine malt and wheat flavors, and even soft touches of puffed rice. The color too suggests substance - deep and golden like a cider. Still, it is a lot to pay for a minute improvement, and when you\u2019ve just given up the whole beer drinking hobby in Japan in favor of munching kaki no pea and drinking sake, the financial disincentives are too strong. I hope that this standard bearer of luxury is knocked on the side of its head, and that one of Japan\u2019s many aspiring craft brewers can show the islands what a good beer is for (even if it costs a couple hundred yen more.) That will be the kind of beer where you can forget your socio-economic or demographic woes, or even better, ponder fixes for them. The Suntory Premium Malts?
