Good sticky lacing with fizzy small carbonation;\r\nQuite fragrant aroma of Ale malt, with strong caramel, toffee, butterscotch, light sugar, thin lemon and light grass. Some tropical fruity nose come through as beer warms; Close to light sweet taste of moderate Ale malt, with caramel, toffee, light red fruits, molasses, light biscuits, lemon, liquorices, moderate bitter hops and quite strong grass;\r\nMid to light body. Slick palate; Mouth Feel is moderate Amber maltyness in a light and strong-carboed background. Strong caramel, toffee and a touch of butterscotch for smoothness. Red fruits and molasses compliments well with good strong lemon to round. Pretty good!... Hoppiness is thin lemon and light grass in nose. Lemon, liquorices, and strong grass in taste; Bitterness is liquorices-like, quite strong for a lasting, mid-to-high astringent sweet malty finish; Fairly dry after taste. Caramel sweet and bitter to mouth.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: This one\u2019s hop flavors is very strong for a Pale Ale, but still the caramel and toffee characters stole the show. Its slightly buttery feel enhances its attractiveness somewhat. Not the most outstanding but certainly enjoyable.

In a tulip the nose is actually fruity floral caramel, mild but decent enough and a pleasant surprise. A zesty med-full mouthfeel. The taste is sweet, a bit fruity and has some caramel hiding behind an earthy dirt like taste. Not sure what happened here, it\u2019s not bad more like the taste is hiding in an underground cellar peeking out at you. Disappointing after the nice aroma, it just comes off as a lobotomized ale.
