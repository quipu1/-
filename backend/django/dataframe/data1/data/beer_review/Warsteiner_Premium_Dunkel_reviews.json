The off-white head formed upon pouring was quite large and had a moderate level of retention. The fading head in the end gave way to a medium amount of lacing.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The aromas were sweet and fruity. They were heaviest of a sweet cherry and apple smell, but also contained a light roasted bready and a light hop smell.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste starts out of a bready, cherry and a lighter roasted flavor. The roasted flavors begin growing stronger after the initial taste. These mix with some flavor of a toast flavor and more cherry as the taste advances further. In the end, these flavors, when mixed with the a lighter earthy hop taste, leave a interesting bitter taste on the tongue (I can\u2019t decide if I like it or not).\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is just a tad above average in terms of creaminess and thickness for a brew of only 4.8%. It also has just a slightly lower than level carbonation. These two qualities are quite nice for the roasted flavors of the brew and help accentuate the fruit and roasted flavors.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 A pretty good brew with some nice fruit and roasted flavors.

Crystal-clear. Forms an average size beige sudsy/frothy head which retains and laces well.\n\nSmell: Even though this is packaged in a brown bottle there is a definite skunkiness to the nose. Not nearly as bad as a Heineken, but a sourness that seems out of place for sure. A close inspection reveals a generic lager smell and hints of roasted malt and coffee.\n\nTaste: Dark lagers are, in my mind, similar to black IPAs - they mess with your head because your eyes see something dark but your mouth tastes something light. Warsteiner Premium Dunkel definitely fits that bill - looks like a high-quality beer; smells like a green bottle macro pilsner, and tastes like a standard German lager but with more refinement.\n\nThe entire first half and even most of the finish consists of a mild, familiar palate. It\u2019s that taste of lagers that conform to the Bavarian Purity Law but don\u2019t have anything substantial or original to them. A light cereal, milled grained taste and mild bitterness. Just as it finishes all the flavor rushes in at once. It\u2019s a pleasant taste of iced coffee, dark chocolate and generic lager all at once. These flavors combine for a simultaneously bitter and sweet palate, yet quite mild overall. The skunked aroma is apparent in the palate - bringing down what should be a good or even excellent beer to one that\u2019s just plain okay.\n\nMouthfeel: On the lighter end of medium bodied. Thicker than your average lager and not quite as fizzy, although carbonation is noticeable. \n\nDrinkability: Though technically a lager, Warsteiner Premium Dunkel doesn\u2019t drink like your average macro lager. Much smoother with a palate of genuine flavor. The sourness in the nose and aftertaste take some time to tolerate, though. The 4.8% ABV is totally accurate and this would make a great session beer if you could get it on tap or in cans.\n\nOverall, I wanted to like and rate Warsteiner Premium Dunkel a little higher than I am, because it is a tasty, drinkable beer - but with flaws that are a little distracting.", "writed_at": "September 30, 2011"}, {"user_id": "Onionkid", "beer_kor_name": "\ubc14\ub974\uc288\ud0c0\uc774\ub108 \ub358\ucf08", "beer_eng_name": "Warsteiner Premium Dunkel", "review_score": 2.4, "review_content": "Bottle.
