Small brown bottle, filtered, from a BeerHawk UK box. I always expect not to like this, and always end up being pleasantly surprised at how tasty and drinkable it is. It's hoppy, but in a tasty not aggressive way. And the malt is fat and juicy. Good marriage.  Works for me. [3.0] \n\nJuly 2019 355ml brown bottle, no residue, part of a Goose Island Flight Pack bought in Lidl. Crisply hopped, but quite pleasant. I quite like this. Toasty notes. Inclines more to British than American style of hoppy pale beer. Yeah. Quite satisfying. [3.0] \n\nJune, 2017 355ml bottle, filtered, from Tesco. Sweet and hoppy. You can feel the malt weight, and the hops are also quite weighty. It\u2019s all a little too sweet and weighty all round for me, but I can see why it would please others. The hops are grown on AB-InBev\u2019s Elk Mountain Farm in Adaho - claimed to be the world\u2019s biggest hop farm. I couldn\u2019t quite work out what hops were used in this Goose IPA. Amarillo? [2.9]\n\nFeb, 2003: This has a hoppy profile like the Golden Summer Ales that British brewers are currently making as fast as the British can consume them.  The fruity malt base is a beautiful counterpoint to the citric hops, and tastes rather English if just a little syrupy. The hops seem to be the main thing here, and they are very tasty. I assume the hops are American because we have no hops this sharp in Britain. Very enjoyable.

Only a small amount of visible carbonation though. Looks okay - bit uninspiring in colour and the head is bizarrely thick, but it's not unpleasant.\n\nAroma isn't brilliant. Soapy is the first word that comes to mind. There's some lemon and a fair hit of pine, but it's undeniably soapy. Difficult to pick up much more. Not great - poorly balanced and although I don't hate the dominant note, it's not exactly one of my favourites either...\n\nTaste is better in that it's just uninspiring. Again, lemon and a fair whack of pine, and a slightly sweeter note - biscuit? Rounded off with a moderate strength surprisingly botanical bitter finish that really lingers. The hops dominate, which isn't a bad thing in an IPA, but it's just quite bland. At least it's not soapy.\n\nPalate is okay. Medium-light body, faintest amount of in-mouth carbonation, a bit slick and oily with a moderate length finish (other than the lingering bitterness). I'd really like it to be a bit cleaner and maybe a touch juicier, although that would be pushing a little away from the west coast style this is clearly going for.\n\nOverall? Meh.

Good thing I bought it at Superstore for six unmatching buttons and a possum that was wedged into the grill of my \u201984 Lada. I felt like I was in a back alley in that store - total shit hole in the beer aisle. Of course, like always, just as I\u2019m about to do a serious take on a beer my cat saunters downstairs to spill his fluids. Maybe I should move the box from on top of the computer table. Initial cautious huffs put this brew up as standard fare but that first taste really crinkled my brow. After a while I came to understand this is not the American ipa i had hoped and instead settled into an English version with some extra sharp emptiness. Fairly plain aroma that tips a bit to the mucky side. What does that mean? I\u2019m not telling you. Caramel, pine that meets acidic qwalitees, dryness, unsweetened grapefrootz and I\u2019m out of beer. The only solution to a quandary such as this is to open another. I\u2019m so stuck inbetween knowing this is a sessionable get fucked up on beer and hating it because it\u2019s just boring and it\u2019s not my style of IPA and tasting a shot of subpar piny caramel and smelling my fingers and discovering I\u2019ve got onion bag from working in the yard. I really am not sure where I\u2019m at - I think I am actually enjoying it cuz it\u2019s drinkable but I\u2019m just such a spoiled hop diva now from drinking challenging excellence yet there is no way this 12 pack will last beyond a handful of days. Is this what I accept now now that my fridge stalwart Tree Hophead has been reformulated and consistently disappoints? Maybe I am sad because this is cheaper and may actually be an upgrade? Maybe it\u2019s because after the very first sip I went straight to the case and searched for a BB date after the former stated crinkling.

The head had a fair level of retention, fading over time to give a lighter amount of lacing.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The aroma was fruity with aromas of orange, pineapple and mango as well as had a nice malty smell. Mixed with these are some hop aromas of a pine and grapefruit citrus nature.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins with some of caramel and bready tastes with a lighter grapefruit citrus hop. As the flavor advances sweeter notes of a tropical and citrus fruit flavor come to tongue with the taste getting sweeter toward the middle. More hop flavors soon come to the tongue and take the taste to its end. A bitter pine and more bitter citrus come to the tongue, drowning out some of the sweet (but not all) and leaving a bready bitter but balanced hopped taste on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer was average in terms of it creaminess/thickness with a carbonation level that was average as well. \r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 A very enjoyable and drinkable IPA.

I find the same can be said of the adjective \"good.\" In other words, it doesn\u2019t matter how many times and in how many different aspects you use the word \"good\" to describe something, since it doesn\u2019t make it better than just plain good. I have a feeling I\u2019m going to use that word quite often to describe Goose Island India Pale Ale. This is a beer that is good in so many ways, but not a great beer. It\u2019s a case of a \"good\" being good enough if \"good enough\" is good enough for you.\n\nAPPEARANCE AND AROMA\n\nI poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. This beer has all the makings of a good IPA right away with a slightly hazy orange body and frothy, off-white head (which leaves some lacing on the glass). It smells quite inviting with a citrusy aroma with notes of pine and some malty sweetness as well. It\u2019s definitely an inviting beer.\n\nTASTE\n\nGoose Island IPA is the kind of India Pale Ale I\u2019d recommend for beginners looking for a good \"jumping on point\" for the style. It begins with a creamy texture which is slightly dry and sweet and finishes with a prominent, slightly crisp, citrus taste. The dynamics of the palette here are quite interesting. The pale malts create for a mild sweetness and the combination of some British hops give the beer the bitterness you expect in an IPA.\n\nAs I drank on I noticed the flavors began to homogenize. The refreshing citrus finish began to dry out making the beer less refreshing than it originally was. The palette began to feel noticeably mild, although I also noticed a slight orange sherbet-like flavor in the aftertaste. For an IPA this beer is not all that bitter. In fact, Goose Island\u2019s website indicates it rates only 55 on the IBU scale. That score is fine if their intention is to make a extremely palatable beer, but for hopheads like me I was left feeling only satisfied instead of genuinely impressed.\n\nDRINKABILITY\n\nWhile the overall taste to Goose Island IPA was good, it probably performed even better in the drinkability department. The mouthfeel is soft, medium-bodied, and it goes down smooth. As it warms it begins to dry out the mouth and the hops begin to linger for a few extra moments, but ultimately it\u2019s still very palatable. \n\nAt only 5.9% ABV this is actually rather light for an IPA. Beers of this style tend to be more robust and weightier, although the trade-off is here is that this would make a good session beer. It would also work well as a dinner drink.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWhile not the best India Pale Ale in the world, Goose Island IPA is still a good beer for its satisfying taste and easy drinkability. I\u2019d prefer something more robust in many ways, but I don\u2019t think this beer is intended to be anything other than a good IPA, and in that aspect the brewers succeeded.\n\nNOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAG-kgM8i78", "writed_at": "August 21, 2010"}, {"user_id": "kwik-lime", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc IPA", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Goose IPA", "review_score": 4.0, "review_content": "I\u2019m not really a massive fan of IPAs as a style but this is excellent.

Creamy texture at first brings a great amount of malt (caramel flavor) to balance the moderate hop bite and citrus acidity.  As those flavors evolve, the texture dries out and leaves a pleasant finish.", "writed_at": "July 10, 2010"}, {"user_id": "Nate", "beer_kor_name": "\uad6c\uc2a4 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc IPA", "beer_eng_name": "Goose Island Goose IPA", "review_score": 3.9, "review_content": "From bottle.

Tested on Best before-date. A golden/copper beer with a nice white head. Gorgeous grapefruity aroma with hints of pine resin.

Since my first sample of this beer, September 2005, I\u2019ve had it on several occasions, but as it seems it will disappear from the Norwegian market, I had to give it one more try. It\u2019s a refreshing and fruity beer with a nice hop profile, and it\u2019s far from extreme, making it rather drinkable. It pours a nice, orange-golden body with a rather small off-white head leaving some fine curtains of foam on the glass. It\u2019s aroma is dominated by citrusy hops, with pine and resin as well. The maltyness is quite subdued, but sweetness and a bready note is detectable in the background. Flavorwise it\u2019s much the same, the fruity hops with it\u2019s pine and resin do most of the job, but the bready, sweet maltyness is doing its part as well. Quite full-bodied it is, and a bit sticky on the palate. In the finish, the malty flavors is even more subdued, leaving more room for bitterness, and of course there\u2019s a lot of fruits, pine and resin too. It\u2019s still a yummy beer, I sure hope it don\u2019t disappear from the already starved Norwegian market.

Consumed 4 months before the \"best by\" date, I\u2019m a bit disappointed in the nose.  Moderately hoppy and lightly malty, there\u2019s also some spoiled vegetal aroma creeping in, and while it\u2019s not nauseating or anything, it\u2019s definitely a distraction.  The flavor is nicely balanced, lightly sweet and malty early, with a fairly mild and bitter hops balancing out the beer in the finish.  Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, smooth on the palate.  Clear, amber color.  Off-white head rises to nearly an inch in height after the pour, and as it slowly settles (and I continue to consume the beer), a fairly solid curtain of lace is left on the glass.  As the lace condenses, it\u2019s very reminiscent of ice crystals that form on a window during a cold winter day.  This is certainly not what I\u2019d consider a hoppy IPA, at least not by west coast standards, but the balance is excellent, and the flavor is pleasant.  A nice, easy drinking IPA is what we have here.15-Aug-05 (Draft: Horse Brass Pub in Portland, OR) Just a quick update about the nose.

It just does not taste like garden-variety cascade hops like so many other IPA\u2019s.
